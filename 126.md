# _revokeRole may cause access control problem .

## Summary
ERC20Token#_revokeRole may cause access control problems due to the improper design of access. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In `ERC20Token.sol`, there are access control functions like   `setXXX` and  `revokeXXX`,  `setXXX` is to change role to another address, and `revokeXXX`  is to revoke one's role. 
 The issue is  according to this function, only one user can have one role, take the guardian role for example:   
```solidity   
 function setGuardian(address newGuardian, address oldGuardian) external onlyGuardian {
        require(newGuardian != address(0), "newGuardian cannot be the zero address");
        _revokeRole(GUARDIAN_ROLE, oldGuardian);
        _grantRole(GUARDIAN_ROLE, newGuardian);
    }
```
once revoke function is  called,  no one will have the guardian role 
```solidity
  
    function revokeGuardian(address oldGuardian) external onlyGuardian {
        require(oldGuardian != address(0), "oldGuardian cannot be the zero address");
        _revokeRole(GUARDIAN_ROLE, oldGuardian);
    }

```
`revokeGuardian`   remove the only one  guardian role , and no one has the guardian role may cause the function can never be accessed.
```solidity
  function pause() external only guardian {
        _pause();
    }
```
 For example, function pause() can never be called because no one has the guardian role.  
## Impact
Methods cannot be accessed.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`revokeGuardian()` is not necessary because this  Contract must have a role to access pause() or other function,  `revokeGuardian()`  can be removed.
