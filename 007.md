# Upgradeable contract is missing a __gap[50] storage variable to allow for new storage variables in later versions

## Summary
Upgradeable contract is missing a __gap[50] storage variable to allow for new storage variables in later versions

## Vulnerability Detail
See [this](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps) link for a description of this storage variable. While some contracts may not currently be sub-classed, adding the variable now protects against forgetting to add it in the future.

## Impact
No new storage variables can be added in the contract

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/d5328421bea80e3b0fd4595e4eb6b732a40e421e/Unitas-Protocol/src/Unitas.sol#L25-L50

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider defining an appropriate storage gap in each upgradeable parent contract at the end of all the storage variable definitions as follows:

```solidity
uint256[50] __gap; // gap to reserve storage in the contract for future variable additions
```
