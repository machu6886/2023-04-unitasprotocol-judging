# Pausing `usd1` minting at <=130% reserve ratio will disable any Stability Burn and revenue distribution from the insurance staking

## Summary
Pausing usd1 minting at <=130% reserve ratio will disable any Stability Burn and revenue distribution from the insurance staking

## Vulnerability Detail
According to the docs, if the Reserve ratio ≤ 130%, the minting of `usd1` will be paused.

As specified on the whitepaper, Unitas conducts `Stability Burn` if the protocol hasn’t reached its minimum over-reservation ratio. 
The problem here is that `usd1` will be paused when reserve ratio <=130% and the pausable method of the `usd1` is shared between the minting and burning function. Therefore any burning that happens for the stability burns, will not be able to be conducted when the protocol needs it more making the reserve ratio go lower.

## Impact
Unable to perform stability burns and revenue distribution

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do not tie pausable to both minting and burning at the same time
