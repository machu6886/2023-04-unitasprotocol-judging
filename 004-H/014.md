# No checking for the portfolio is less than or equal to the collateral.

## Summary
The withdrawCollateral function does not check if the contract has enough balance before attempting to transfer tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the withdrawer calls withdrawCollateral with a portfolio greater than the collateral. The subtraction operation underflows, and the check passes even though there's not enough collateral to cover the withdrawal.

## Impact
Based on the `withdrawCollateral()` function, if the portfolio is greater than the collateral, the subtraction operation collateral - portfolio will underflow and result in a very large number. 

The check `collateral - portfolio >= amount` will then likely pass, even if there's not enough collateral to cover the withdrawal.
