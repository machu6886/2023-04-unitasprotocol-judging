# Reserve ratio can flicker below 100% and allow minting of USD1

## Summary

According to Architecture Overview documentation, all minting should be permanently disabled when reserve ratio dips below 100%:

> Reserve ratio â‰¤ 100%: stop all minting permanently

Only exits from USD_EMC to USD1 and USD1 to USDT should be allowed. However, nothing prevents the system to have reserve ratio dipping below 100% and back up above 100% and resuming minting activities.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function to verify the reserve ratios is `_checkReserveRatio()`:

This function is called at the end of a `swap()`:

The function will revert when the reserve ratio is below the threshold for the swapped pair (threshold is set by the governor). There is no additional condition for the call reverting.

There can be a scenario where:
- reserve ratio is 101%
- price of USD_EMC appreciates relative to USD
- reserve ratio decreases to 99%
- only exits from the protocol are allowed
- users swap USD_EMC for USD1 and USD1 for USDT
- price of USD_EMC depreciate against USD
- reserve ratio increases back to 101%
- minting of USD_EMC by swapping USD1 is enabled

## Impact

When ratio drops below 100%, safety of the protocol is no longer ensured and minting should be permanently disabled. If protocol is no longer considered safe, user funds added to the protocol may be at risk.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a boolean flag `exitOnly` set to `true` when `_checkReserveRatio()` observes a ratio below `100%` and revert every USD1 -> USD_EMC and USDT -> USD1 swaps when flag is `true`.
