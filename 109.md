# Timelock functionally is implemented superficially

## Summary

The timelock only provides superficial assurances that certain function calls cannot be immediately executed.

## Vulnerability Detail

Currently, the timelock functionality is implemented via a role system using an OpenZeppelin Access Control `TIMELOCK_ROLE`. This role is given to the `TimelockController` contract and a modifier is added to certain functions in the `Unitas` contract. 

The issue is that the `TIMELOCK_ROLE` can easily be given to other accounts/contracts, bypassing all timelock functionality. This is because the `TIMELOCK_ROLE` is not a role that is specific to the `TimelockController` contract, but rather a role that can be given to any actor. All timelock functionality is internal to the `TimeLockController` contract.

## Impact

The impact is that the timelock functionality is not actually enforced in a meaningful way.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

At a bare minimum the `TIMELOCK_ROLE` should be administrated by the `TimelockController` contract. Ideally, the timelock functionality should be implemented in a way that is not dependent on a role system.
