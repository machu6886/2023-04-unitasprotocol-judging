# XO-checkContract() function does not check if the contract has been renounced

## Summary
- The `checkContract()` function does not check if the contract has been renounced before calling the `extcodesize()` opcode. This means that an attacker can renounce a contract and then pass the address of the contract to the `checkContract()` function. The function will not `revert`, and the attacker will be able to execute arbitrary code on the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
*/
    function checkContract(address account) internal view {
        checkNotZero(account);

        uint256 size;
        assembly {
            size := extcodesize(account)
        }
        _require(size > 0, Errors.ADDRESS_CODE_SIZE_ZERO);
    }

```
- The vulnerability in the `checkContract()` function is that it does not check if the contract has been renounced before calling the `extcodesize()` opcode. This means that an attacker can renounce a contract and then pass the address of the contract to the `checkContract()` function. The function will not revert, and the attacker will be able to execute arbitrary code on the contract
## Impact
- An attacker could `renounce` the contract and then pass the address of the contract to the `checkContract()` function. The function will not revert, and the attacker will be able to execute `arbitrary` code on the contract. The attacker could then steal all of the `funds` that are `deposited` in the contract.

## Recommendation
- the `checkContract()` function should check if the contract has been renounced before calling the `extcodesize()` opcode.
