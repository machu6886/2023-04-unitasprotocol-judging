# Price updates vulerable to sandwitch attacks

## Summary

Changes to asset prices via the `XOracle` make the protocol vulnerable to sandwitch attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

A malicious actor can watch the mempool for calls to `putPrice` and/or `updatePrices` and front run the call with a swap, acquiring  a position that will be advantageous after the price change. 

After the call to `putPrice`/`updatePrices` goes through, they simply swap back to their original position for a profit.

## Impact

Potentially ever price update can be used in a sandwitch attack to steal funds from the protocol.
