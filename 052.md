# Custom oracle is a security risk

## Summary
The system uses a custom oracle that is fed data through a single EOA. The system is at risk of either being fully compromised, EOA keys being stolen, or the EOA providing wrong data by mistake.

## Vulnerability Detail
Just like you shouldn't run your own cryptography, you shouldn't build a custom oracle. These things aren't as easy as they look.

The current setup has a single EOA that provides price data to the XOracle contract:

```sol
    function putPrice(address asset, uint64 timestamp, uint256 price) public onlyRole(FEEDER_ROLE) {
        uint64 prev_timestamp = prices[asset].timestamp;
        uint256 prev_price = prices[asset].price;
        require(prev_timestamp < timestamp, "Outdated timestamp");
        prices[asset] = IOracle.Price(asset, timestamp, prev_timestamp, price, prev_price);
        emit newPrice(asset, timestamp, price);
    }
```

Keys being compromised is not just a theoretical issue. In practice, there were multiple protocols that didn't secure their keys properly resulting in millions of dollars that were lost:

Harmony loses $100M because multiple keys on different machines were compromised. 
- https://rekt.news/raydium-rekt/
The private key of the owner of Raydium contracts is compromised resulting in a loss of $4M.

Having a single EOA be responsible for freely providing price data that is vital to the system is very risky.

Also, having your own price data could provide arbitrage opportunities if they divert from other on-chain oracles, e.g. Chainlink or Uniswap. You might value USDT higher than the rest allowing people to dump their USD1 for more USDT than they should. At the same time, you have to build a reliable backend that can provide current price data without major outages. A big engineering challenge that most large companies struggle with.

Since you plan on deploying on Mainnet there's no reason to not just integrate one of the existing industry standard solutions, e.g. Chainlink.

## Impact
A vital part of the protocol, pricing of the underlying assets, is built with significant security risks. The EOA being compromised or providing outdated data will break the whole protocol.

## Recommendation
Switch to Chainlink instead of rolling your own oracle
