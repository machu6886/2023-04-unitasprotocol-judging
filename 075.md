# XO-Timestamp Validation Missing in updatePrices Function

## Summary
- The vulnerability is in the `updatePrices` function, which accepts an array of `IOracle.NewPrice` structs as input and updates the prices for corresponding assets. However, the function fails to validate whether the timestamp of a new price is greater than the previous timestamp. 
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
}
    function updatePrices(IOracle.NewPrice[] calldata _array) external onlyRole(FEEDER_ROLE) {
        uint256 arrLength = _array.length;
        for(uint256 i=0; i<arrLength; ){
            address asset = _array[i].asset;
            uint64 timestamp = _array[i].timestamp;
            uint256 price = _array[i].price;
            putPrice(asset, timestamp, price);
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```
-The vulnerability is in the `updatePrices` function, the `updatePrices` function takes an array of `IOracle.NewPrice` structs as `input`. Each `IOracle.NewPrice` struct contains the asset's address, the timestamp of the new price, The new price, so the `updatePrices` function then iterates through the array and calls the putPrice function to update the price for each asset. However, the updatePrices function does not check to make sure that the `timestamp` of the new price is greater than the previous `timestamp` means that an attacker could create a `NewPrice` struct with a `timestamp` that is less than the previous `timestamp`. If the attacker is able to do this, the `updatePrices` function will update the price for the asset to the attacker's desired price.
## Impact
- The vulnerability allow an attacker to manipulate the price of an asset by creating a `NewPrice` struct with a `timestamp` that is `less` than the previous `timestamp`, . If the attacker is able to do this, the `updatePrices` function will update the price for the asset to the attacker's desired price.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
-  the `updatePrices` function should be modified to check the `timestamp` of the new price to make sure that it is greater than the previous `timestamp`.
