# TimelockController.sol: Arbitrary Ether Transfer Vulnerability

## Summary
The _execute function in the TimelockController contract allows the execution of arbitrary calls to external contracts and the transfer of Ether without proper validation or checks.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the _execute function, the target contract's call function is used to execute a call with a specified value of Ether. However, there is no validation or restriction on the target contract or the data being passed. This allows arbitrary calls to be made and Ether to be transferred to any address
## Impact
The vulnerability enables an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the TimelockController contract and transfer Ether to any address. This can lead to unauthorized actions, including the manipulation of contract state, theft of funds, or disruption of contract functionality.
## Code Snippet
The vulnerability exists in the _execute function at line 340 of the TimelockController.sol file.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/TimelockController.sol#L340
<pre><code>
function _execute(address target, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) internal virtual {
    (bool success, ) = target.call{value: value}(data);
    require(success, "TimelockController: underlying transaction reverted");
}
</code></pre>

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix the vulnerability in the _execute function of the TimelockController contract, you should implement proper checks and restrictions on the target contract and the data being passed. Here's a possible fix:
<pre><code>
function _execute(address target, uint256 value, bytes calldata data) internal virtual {
    require(target != address(0), "TimelockController: invalid target address");
    require(value == 0, "TimelockController: Ether value not allowed");

    (bool success, ) = target.call(data);
    require(success, "TimelockController: underlying transaction reverted");
}
</code></pre>
<em>
The first check ensures that the target address is not the zero address. This prevents the execution of arbitrary calls to an invalid or non-existent contract.
The second check ensures that no Ether value is specified. This prevents unintended transfers of Ether along with the call.
The call to target.call is made without specifying the value parameter. This prevents accidental or unauthorized transfers of Ether. </em>
