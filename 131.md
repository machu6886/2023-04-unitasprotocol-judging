# No Slippage Parameter where the `Minimum of tokens` to get after a `swap` is done  is set to `zero` by default, `swaps` are prone to `sandwich attacks`.

[Line with Bug](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/Unitas.sol#L208)
## Summary 
The amount of `EMCs(eg USD1, USD91)` minted and received by a user when swapping with their `collateral/USD/(other EMCs)`, can be decreased to an unlimited extent by manipulating the reserves of the pool leading to the user getting fewer `EMCs(eg USD1, USD91)` than requested.

## Vulnerability Detail
This issue is in the `Unitas.sol` contract at the `swap` function.
```solidity
      function swap(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, AmountType amountType, uint256 amount)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOut)
    {
```

There is no parameter that allows a user to set the minimum amount of `EMCs` they should get after swapping their collateral for `EMCs`, and in a situation like this the slippage is set to `zero` by default meaning the user can get as low as `zero` amount of `EMCs` for any amount of `collateral/Tokens`, which will lead to loss of funds.
POC
Here a user is expected send `collateral/Tokens` to the pool and the equivalent amount of `EMCs` are minted and to be sent to the user. However, the user canâ€™t specify the minimum amount of `EMCs` that they would accept. A `frontrunner/MEV` can then manipulate the reserves of the pool via `FLASHLOANS` in order to make the reserves appear more valuable than it really is so the user receives `EMCs` that are worth much less than what collateral is worth.
## Impact
Users who trying to swaps the `funds` for `EMCs`, are left unprotected from `slippage attacks` as they could get as low as `zero` amount of `EMCs` when the swap with their tokens. leading to loss of funds due to `MEV/FlashLoan` attacks

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add an argument for the minimum amount of `tokens` to get after a `swap` for an equivalent `collateral/Tokens` to enable the users secure themselves against such `attacks`.
