# Cannot receive any yield profits from portfolio usage

## Summary
Funds from reserves or the insurance pool can be used as a "portfolio" in external protocols to produce revenue, however, any revenue produced cannot be received for use by Unitas.

## Vulnerability Detail
[The following check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/PoolBalances.sol#L71) in `PoolBalances._receivePortfolio()` doesn't account for any yield externally generated by the portfolio. When an attempt is made to receive an `amount` greater than the initial `portfolio` (minus any amount received in previous transactions), the receive will revert with `Errors.AMOUNT_INVALID`.
```javascript
        uint256 portfolio = _getPortfolio(token);
        _require(amount <= portfolio, Errors.AMOUNT_INVALID);

        _setPortfolio(token, portfolio - amount);
```

## Impact
Yield revenue cannot be received by the protocol to increase reserves or distribute to insurance providers.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the limit on amount of portfolio funds received (but still protect against underflow when updating the internal portfolio value [on this line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/PoolBalances.sol#L71)), modify `test_receivePortfolio_FailWhenAmountOverPortfolio()` accordingly and add a test that simulates receiving portfolio plus yield proceeds.
