# Blacklisting and minter role administration is mutually exclusive causing conflict in operational functions

## Summary
The current implementation of ERC20Token contract takes a mutually exclusive implementation for managing Blacklist and minters. 

But, when actually mint or burn functions are called, both the aspect for the caller are checked. As a result, even though the admin functions will operate to manage Minters and blacklist, the actually operational function will not work as expected.

It is appropriate to implement checks in the Admin function to make sure that the user who is becoming a minter is not on the blacklist and some one who is a minter cannot be blacklisted to avoid an operational conflict in the subsequent functions.

## Vulnerability Detail
The mint and burn functions of ERC20Token will not work as expected as there are separate modifiers Minter role check and Blacklisting check. But the same is not there while setting up an account, as those two admin function are kept mutually exclusive.



## Impact
The supply for ERC20Token cannot be managed.

Below functions of the contract will not work

1. mint
2. burn
3. transfer
4. transferFrom
5. approve
6. increaseAllowance
7. decreaseAllowance

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/ERC20Token.sol#L171-L175

```Solidity 
function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external onlyMinter whenNotPaused notBlacklisted(account) {
        require(amount != 0, "Invalid amount");
        _mint(account, amount);
        emit Mint(account, amount);
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/ERC20Token.sol#L184-L188

```Solidity 
 function burn(address burner, uint256 amount) external onlyMinter whenNotPaused notBlacklisted(burner) {
        require(amount != 0, "Invalid amount");
        _burn(burner, amount);
        emit Burn(burner, amount);
    }
```


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/ERC20Token.sol#L195-L198

```Solidity 
 function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public whenNotPaused notBlacklisted(msg.sender) notBlacklisted(recipient) override returns (bool) {
        _transfer(_msgSender(), recipient, amount);
        return true;
    }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/ERC20Token.sol#L205-L250

and functions below are also will not work.

1. transferFrom
3. approve
4. increaseAllowance
5. decreaseAllowance


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make the admin functions to check before adding the Minter role to ensure that account not blacklisted
and like wise before adding to blacklist, make sure the account does not have minter role. This is an additional defence to protect against human error.
