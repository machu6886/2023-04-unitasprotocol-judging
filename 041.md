# Unitas includes funds inside portfolio when calculating total reserves

## Summary
Unitas includes funds inside the portfolio when calculating total reserves.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol team is able to withdraw collateral from the Unitas contract to the portfolio address. Those funds are then deposited into yield-earning protocols to generate revenue for the protocol.

When the total amount of collateral is calculated, the amount stored in the portfolio is also included. But, those funds are not accessible to the end user. When they redeem their USD1 for the underlying asset, you can only access the funds inside the Unitas contract and the insurance pool.

In `_swapOut()`, the portfolio amount is subtracted from `_getBalance(token)` to get the actual amount of tokens that are available:
```sol
            uint256 tokenReserve = _getBalance(token);
            uint256 reserveAmount = amount.min(tokenReserve - _getPortfolio(token));

            if (amount > reserveAmount) {
                uint256 collateralAmount = amount - reserveAmount;

                // Pull the collateral from insurance pool
                IInsurancePool(insurancePool).withdrawCollateral(token, collateralAmount);
            }

            _setBalance(token, tokenReserve - reserveAmount);
            IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
```

That's not done in`_getTotalReservesAndCollaterals()`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/Unitas.sol#L508

## Impact
`_getTotalReservesAndCollaterals()` returns a higher value than it should for the total collateral amount allowing the actual reserve ratio to be lower than it should.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Subtract `getPortfolio(token)` from `getBalance(token)`.
