# Guardian can't be removed by Governor

## Summary
The guardian role can only be assigned by another guardian instead of the governor. This breaks the access control hierarchy.

## Vulnerability Detail
In a given access control scheme, each level of access is granted by a role **higher** than the one assigned. For example, the Unitas protocol access control has the following layers:
Timelock -> Governor (4/7 MultiSig) -> Guardian (2/3 MultiSig)
With each layer, the security and amount of access decreases.

In ERC20Token, three roles are assigned in the constructor:
- Governor
- Guardian
- Minter
```sol
    constructor(
        string memory name_,
        string memory symbol_,
        address governor_,
        address guardian_,
        address minter_
    ) ERC20(name_, symbol_) {
        _setRoleAdmin(GOVERNOR_ROLE, GOVERNOR_ROLE);
        _setRoleAdmin(GUARDIAN_ROLE, GUARDIAN_ROLE);
        _setRoleAdmin(MINTER_ROLE, GOVERNOR_ROLE);
        _grantRole(GOVERNOR_ROLE, governor_);
        _grantRole(GUARDIAN_ROLE, guardian_);
        _grantRole(MINTER_ROLE, minter_);
    }
```

But, the guardian role is fully independent of the other roles. Only a guardian can add new guardians or remove existing ones.

```sol
    function setGuardian(address newGuardian, address oldGuardian) external onlyGuardian {
        require(newGuardian != address(0), "newGuardian cannot be the zero address");
        _revokeRole(GUARDIAN_ROLE, oldGuardian);
        _grantRole(GUARDIAN_ROLE, newGuardian);
    }
```

Given that the security of a guardian is lower than that of the governor or timelock contract, there's a risk of it being compromised easier than the other ones.

By only allowing the governor/timelock to control the guardian role, you can recover from compromised keys by deleting their access and undoing all of their txs. With the current setup, there's nothing you can do when the MultiSig with the guardian role is compromised.

Compromised keys are a real issue and should be treated as highly as smart contract logic issues:

## Impact
The guardian is able to modify the token's blacklist. That allows them to lock up all of the funds in circulation: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/ERC20Token.sol#L259

## Recommendation
Only allow the governor to grant and revoke the guardian role. That way you can undo any damages made by a rogue guardian.
