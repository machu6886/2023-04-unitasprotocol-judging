# Oracle update could be sandwiched

## Summary

Oracle update could be sandwiched. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Protocol uses its own oracle for receiving current prices of tokens. A trusted 'feeder' role would update Oracle data:
```solidity
File: XOracle.sol
34:     function updatePrices(IOracle.NewPrice[] calldata _array) external onlyRole(FEEDER_ROLE) { 
35:         uint256 arrLength = _array.length;
36:         for(uint256 i=0; i<arrLength; ){
37:             address asset = _array[i].asset;
38:             uint64 timestamp = _array[i].timestamp;
39:             uint256 price = _array[i].price;
40:             putPrice(asset, timestamp, price);
41:             unchecked {
42:                 i++;
43:             }
44:         }
45:     }
```

Freshly updated prices could be used immediately in mining/burning calls. While there are fees for minting and burning, protocol documentation state about the possibility that this fee could be reduced to 0. Also, there is the possibility of rapid price changes that overcome mint and burn fee size.

This opens an opportunity for a sandwich attack:
1. Attacker spot updating prices tx in mempool. In case this tx would increase the price of some of the EMCs - the attacker mints enormous amounts of this EMC.
2. Price updates.
3. Attacker burns all EMC tokens from step 1, basically draining protocol reserves.

Simple pausing minting before oracle updates would not mitigate this attack vector, since it would be obvious to the attacker that pausing is leading to oracle updates, and due to the openness of EMCs prices - it would be predictable how prices would change in oracle.

## Impact

Protocol reserves could be drained due to sandwiching of oracle updates.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing a timelock restriction to prevent frequent token burning or minting. Alternatively, impose a restriction that prevents the token price from being updated by a percentage greater than the current mint and burn fees, this would guarantee the unprofitability of such attacks.
