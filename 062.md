# Corruptible Upgradability Pattern

## Summary
Storage of the  `Unitas` contracts might be corrupted during an upgrade.



## Vulnerability Detail

<img width="798" alt="image" src="https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol-0xffff11/assets/123578292/9340a1df-866f-42b5-a721-4d36c221e982">


The Unitas contract is meant to be upgradeable. However, it inherits contracts that are not upgrade-safe.

The gap storage has been implemented on the `PoolBalances` contract inherited by Unitas

However, no gap storage is implemented on the `SwapFunctions` contract.

Thus, adding new storage variables to this inherited contract can potentially overwrite the beginning of the storage layout of the child contract. causing critical misbehaviors in the system.

## Impact

Storage might be corrupted during upgrading, thus causing the contract to be broken and assets to be stuck.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider defining an appropriate storage gap in the `SwapFunctions` contract at the end of all the storage variable definitions as follows:

```@solidity
uint256[50] __gap; // gap to reserve storage in the contract for future variable additions
```
