The Boosted3TokenAuraVault and MetaStable2TokenAuraVault vaults are meant to be upgradeable. However, it inherits contracts that are not upgrade-safe.

The gap storage has been implemented on the BaseStrategyVault and BalancerStrategyBase contracts inherited by the Boosted3TokenAuraVault and MetaStable2TokenAuraVault vaults.

However, no gap storage is implemented on the Boosted3TokenPoolMixin, MetaStable2TokenVaultMixin, TwoTokenPoolMixin, PoolMixin, AuraStakingMixin and BalancerOracleMixin contracts inherited by the Boosted3TokenAuraVault and MetaStable2TokenAuraVault vaults.

Thus, adding new storage variables to any of these inherited contracts can potentially overwrite the beginning of the storage layout of the child contract. causing critical misbehaviors in the system.

## Impact

Storage of Boosted3TokenAuraVault and MetaStable2TokenAuraVault vaults might be corrupted during upgrading, thus causing the vaults to be broken and assets to be stuck.

NOTE not sure if token Manager should be upgradeable

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider defining an appropriate storage gap in each upgradeable parent contract at the end of all the storage variable definitions as follows:

```@solidity
uint256[50] __gap; // gap to reserve storage in the contract for future variable additions
```
