# Front-running of addBlackList() function

## Summary

It's possible to prevent funds from being locked by the blacklist

## Vulnerability Detail

Malicious users that should be blacklisted can run a script to monitor the mempool and listen for a transaction that calls addBlackList() for their addresses, and front run the transaction that calls addBlackList() with a higher gas fee to transfer their tokens away before they are added to the blacklist, effectively preventing their funds from being locked

## Impact

Malicious users that should be blacklisted can prevent their funds to be locked
