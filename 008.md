# Insufficient timestamp validation can block price update

## Summary

insufficient timestamp validation in xOracle contract can block future assets price update. 

## Vulnerability Detail

When Feeder updates the price for any asset it uses putPrice function where it should also place a timestamp value as an argument that has to be higher than the previous one. In case of any misspell in timestamp extremely high value can be saved. And it will prevent any future price updates for a long time because of the require check. So the protocol will use stale prices with no chance to update them.

## Impact

The protocol will have to use stale prices for assets and its users will loose money on swaps.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/XOracle.sol#L29

```solidity
    function putPrice(address asset, uint64 timestamp, uint256 price) public onlyRole(FEEDER_ROLE) {
        uint64 prev_timestamp = prices[asset].timestamp;
        uint256 prev_price = prices[asset].price;
        require(prev_timestamp < timestamp, "Outdated timestamp");
        prices[asset] = IOracle.Price(asset, timestamp, prev_timestamp, price, prev_price);
        emit newPrice(asset, timestamp, price);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's better to limit max timestamp value that can be saved. For example if you plan to update prices ones in a week, so provide a check to let timestamp in the arguments to not be higher than `timestamp+1 week`.
