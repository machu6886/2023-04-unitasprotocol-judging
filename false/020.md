# XOracles does not have admin function to manager feeder role

## Summary
XOracle contract manages the prices feed for the assets supported. The contract sets the feeder address at the time of the constructor and does not make provision to manage the feeder role across accounts.

In the scenario of feeder not being able to update the prices for the assets, there is no provision made in the contract to assign the feeder role to a new account.

At the same time the role of governor is not evident.

## Vulnerability Detail
Feeder role is set to an account with the assumption that a single account will provide the prices for assets in the contract. The feeder is set at the time of deployment. In the case where the feeder becomes no operational or reachable due to human factors, there is no provision made in the contract to assign the feeder role to a new account.

Also, the governor role is redundant.

## Impact
Incase feeder account access was lost, this project will not be able to function any more as the price feed will stop for the assets listed. The price will remain stale and users will move out of this project to safe guard them selves from the risk of stale prices.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/XOracle.sol#L14-L22

```solidity
constructor() {
        // Grant the contract deployer the default admin role: it will be able
        // to grant and revoke any roles
        _setRoleAdmin(GUARDIAN_ROLE, GUARDIAN_ROLE);
        _setRoleAdmin(FEEDER_ROLE, GUARDIAN_ROLE);
        
        _grantRole(GUARDIAN_ROLE, msg.sender);
        _grantRole(FEEDER_ROLE, msg.sender);
    }
```

Functionality entitled to Feeder role only - single account.
```solidity
function putPrice(address asset, uint64 timestamp, uint256 price) public onlyRole(FEEDER_ROLE) {
        uint64 prev_timestamp = prices[asset].timestamp;
        uint256 prev_price = prices[asset].price;
        require(prev_timestamp < timestamp, "Outdated timestamp");
        prices[asset] = IOracle.Price(asset, timestamp, prev_timestamp, price, prev_price);
        emit newPrice(asset, timestamp, price);
    }

    function updatePrices(IOracle.NewPrice[] calldata _array) external onlyRole(FEEDER_ROLE) {
        uint256 arrLength = _array.length;
        for(uint256 i=0; i<arrLength; ){
            address asset = _array[i].asset;
            uint64 timestamp = _array[i].timestamp;
            uint256 price = _array[i].price;
            putPrice(asset, timestamp, price);
            unchecked {
                i++;
            }
        }
    }
```

## Recommendation
Enable governor to manager feeder role by adding functions to add and revoke feeder role
