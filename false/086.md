# _getSwapResult() won't use inverted price when buying usd1

## Summary
_getSwapResult() won't use inverted price when buying usd1

## Vulnerability Detail
This is basically caused by the code ordering,  because _calculateSwapResult() is done before the price is inverted

```solidity
 (amountIn, amountOut, fee) = _calculateSwapResult(request); //@audit-info this is done without inverting the price when buying USD1

        _require(amountIn > 0 && amountOut > 0, Errors.SWAP_RESULT_INVALID);

        if (tokenIn == priceQuoteToken) {//@audit-info this is done after the swap result has been calculated.
            // The base currency of oracle price is USD1, inverts the price when buying USD1
            price = request.priceBase * request.priceBase / price;
```


## Impact
the inverted price won't be used when buying USD1

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
re-order the code and have the price inversion 
```solidity
   if (tokenIn == priceQuoteToken) {//@audit-info this should be done before swap result is  calculated.
            // The base currency of oracle price is USD1, inverts the price when buying USD1
            price = request.priceBase * request.priceBase / price;
```
done before `  _calculateSwapResult(request);` is done.
