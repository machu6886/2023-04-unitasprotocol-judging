# `Unitas.sendPortfolio()` can cause Unitas to fall below reserve ratio

## Summary
`Unitas.sendPortfolio()` can cause Unitas to fall below the reserve ratio which will prevent users from redeeming USD1 for the underlying asset or minting new USD1.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol team can withdraw the collateral inside Unitas to the portfolio address to deposit them into yield-earning protocols.

The Unitas contract allows you to pull as many tokens as you want. But, there should be a check to prevent it from falling below the reserve ratio threshold:

```sol
    function _sendPortfolio(address token, address receiver, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        AddressUtils.checkNotZero(token);
        AddressUtils.checkNotZero(receiver);
        _checkAmountPositive(amount);
        _require(receiver != address(this), Errors.RECEIVER_INVALID);

        uint256 portfolio = _getPortfolio(token);
        amount = amount.min(_getBalance(token) - portfolio);

        _require(amount > 0, Errors.POOL_BALANCE_INSUFFICIENT);

        _setPortfolio(token, portfolio + amount);

        IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);

        emit PortfolioSent(token, receiver, amount);
    }
```

If you pull enough funds, the `_checkReserveRatio()` function at the end of the `swap()` function will fail: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/Unitas.sol#L234

**Note**: Currently, the tokens inside the portfolio are included in the total collateral calculation. But, that's an issue as well which I describe here: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol-0xruhum/issues/1 So under the assumption that that issue is fixed, you also have to add a check here that prevents the reserve ratio from falling below the threshold.

## Recommendation
Add a check to `sendPortfolio` to prevent it from falling below the reserve ratio threshold.
