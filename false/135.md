# Stale Prices could be returned due to lack of rounding chek on the getLatestPrie Function.

[Bug origin](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/XOracle.sol#L59)
## Summary
There is no check in the `getLatestPrice()` function of the `oracles` for `round completeness`, or the returned `timestamp`, and this could lead to `stale`, `outdated`, or `wrong price return value`, which could affect other functions that depend on the `getLatestPrice()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `XOracle.sol` contract the `getLatestPrice`
```solidity
    function getLatestPrice(address asset) public view returns (uint256) {
        return prices[asset].price;
    }
```
According to `Chainlink's` documentation, this function does not error if no answer has been reached but returns 0 or outdated round data. The external `Chainlink` `oracle`, which provides index price information to the system, introduces risk inherent to any dependency on third-party data sources. For example, the `oracle` could fall behind or otherwise fail to be maintained, resulting in outdated data being fed to the `index` price calculations. `Oracle's` reliance has historically resulted in crippled on-chain systems , and complications that lead to these outcomes can arise from things as simple as network congestion .

## Impact
This could lead to `stale prices` and `wrong price return value`, or `outdated prices`.
As a result, the functions that rely on accurate `price feed` might not work as expected due to wrong calculations made with `stale prices`, which sometimes can lead to `fund` loss. The impacts vary and depend on specific situations.

## Recommendation
Validate `getLatestPrice()` for `round completeness` and for returned `timestamp`
