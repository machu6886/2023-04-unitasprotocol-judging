# The _validateFeeFraction function allows for a fee fraction of 0/0 in `SwapFunctions.sol`

## Summary
The _validateFeeFraction function allows for a fee fraction of 0/0.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_validateFeeFraction()` function in the smart contract currently allows for a fee fraction of 0/0, which is undefined in mathematics. If a function that uses `_validateFeeFraction()` is called with a fee fraction of 0/0, the function will proceed because `_validateFeeFraction()` considers this fraction valid. However, when this fee fraction is used later in the function (for example, in `_getFeeByAmountWithFee` or `_getFeeByAmountWithoutFee`), the calculation becomes undefined because it involves a division by zero. This could lead to unexpected behavior or even a contract failure.

## Impact
If the fee fraction is used to calculate fees, a fraction of 0/0 could lead to incorrect fee calculations.

## Recommendation
Add a check to ensure that if the numerator is zero, the denominator must also be non-zero.
