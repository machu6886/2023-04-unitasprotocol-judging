# There's no function to withdraw ETH received via receive() function, ETH can be stuck in TimelockController.sol

## Summary
no function to pull out ETH received via the receive() function

## Vulnerability Detail
When designing smart contracts that receive ETH through the receive() function, it is essential to include a withdrawal function to pull out that received ETH.

Without a withdrawal function, ETH received through the receive() function may become trapped within the contract. This situation can arise due to unexpected behavior or limitations of the contract's logic. By incorporating a withdrawal function, users can ensure that funds are not unintentionally left within the contract, providing a safety net against stuck or stranded funds.

## Impact
ETH can be stuck in the TimelockController.sol contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a withdraw() function, so as to ensure that the sent ETH is withdrawable to avoid stuck funds.
