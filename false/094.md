# USDT must approve by zero first

## Summary

Unitas Protocol fully relies on USDT stablecoin as an asset. But  USDT does not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value.
USDT  `approve()` function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

## Vulnerability Detail

USDT token will revert when updating the allowance. USDT must first be approved by zero and then the actual allowance must be approved. Because Unitas Protocol fully relies on USDT, you can implement approve by zero in the `ERC20Token.sol` contract.

## Impact

The protocol cannot use USDT unless it is first approved by zero.

## Recommendation
