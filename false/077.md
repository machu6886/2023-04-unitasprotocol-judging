# XO-withdrawCollateral function allows attacker to withdraw more collateral than they have deposited.

## Summary
- The `withdrawCollateral` function in the code you provided does not check to make sure that the amount is greater than or equal to the amount of collateral that the user has deposited. This means that an attacker could call this function with a negative `amount`, and the function would succeed, even though the user does not have enough `collateral` to `withdraw`.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
interface IInsurancePool {
    function depositCollateral(address token, uint256 amount) external;

    function withdrawCollateral(address token, uint256 amount) external;

    function receivePortfolio(address token, uint256 amount) external;

    function sendPortfolio(address token, address receiver, uint256 amount) external;

    function GUARDIAN_ROLE() external view returns (bytes32);

    function WITHDRAWER_ROLE() external view returns (bytes32);

    function getCollateral(address token) external view returns (uint256);

    function getPortfolio(address token) external view returns (uint256);
}
```
- There is a vulnerability in `IInsurancePool` interface, the problem is in the `withdrawCollateral()` function,it's does not check to make sure that the `amount` is greater than or equal to the `amount` of `collateral` that the user has `deposited`. This means that an attacker could call this function with a negative `amount`, and the function would `succeed`, even though the user does not have enough `collateral` to `withdraw`.
## Impact
- This vulnerability allows an attacker to withdraw more collateral than they have deposited.

## Recommendation
-Adding a check to the `withdrawCollateral` function to make sure that the `amount` is greater than or equal to the `amount` of `collateral` that the user has `deposited`.
