# Accounting for fee-on-transfer tokens like USDT, can mess up the internal balances

## Summary
If **USDT** is upgraded to have a fee-on-transfer feature, it could potentially create significant issues in internal accounting. Currently, the [`swap()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/Unitas.sol#L208-L237) function assumes a 0% fee on transfers between USDT and USD1, where USD1 is pegged to USDT.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's consider the scenario of swapping USDT for USD1. The `swap()` function involves two steps:
  -  `_swapIn()`, which transfers USDT to Unitas
  - ` _swapOut()`, which transfers USD1 back to the user. 
  
  The problem lies in the `_swapIn()` function, specifically in the following code snippet:
```jsx
        if (tokenType == ITokenManager.TokenType.Asset) {
            _setBalance(token, _getBalance(token) + amount);//@audit fee on tranfer fails
            IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(spender, address(this), amount);
        } 
```
The issue is that `_setBalance()` is called with the amount parameter, without considering how much USDT has actually been received.

For example:
  -  USDT applies a 1% fee on transfers.
  -  A user wants to swap 1000 USDT.
  -  `_swapIn()` will execute `_setBalance(token, _getBalance(token) + 1000 USDT)`. However, the contract will only receive 990 USDT due to the 1% fee.

## Impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In order to address this issue, it is recommended to modify the `_swapIn()` function as follows:
```jsx
        if (tokenType == ITokenManager.TokenType.Asset) {
             uint balanceBefore = getReserve(token)
             IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(spender, address(this), amount);
             uint balanceAfter = getReserve(token);
            _setBalance(token, _getBalance(token) + balanceAfter-balanceBefore);
        } 
```
Also you will need to account how many tokens are minted with `_swapOut()`
