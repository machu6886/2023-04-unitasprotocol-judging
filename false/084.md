# XO-Incorrect type for rounding argument in scaleByBases function.

## Summary
- The `scaleByBases` function expects the third argument to be a rounding mode. The` MathUpgradeable`.Rounding type is an `enum` that represents the different rounding modes. The uint`256` type can also be used to represent a rounding mode. The rounding argument in the `scaleByBase`s function is of type `MathUpgradeable`.Rounding. However, the rounding argument should be of type uint256. This is because the mulDiv function expects the third argument to be a rounding mode. The uint256 type is compatible with the mulDiv function, and it can be used to represent a rounding mode.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
  /**
     * @notice Scale value by bases
     * @param sourceValue Value of the source to scale
     * @param sourceBase Base of the source, e.g., 1e18
     * @param targetBase Base of the target, e.g., 1e6
     * @param rounding Rounding mode that is `Up` or `Down`
     * @return Value of the target
     */
    function scaleByBases(
        uint256 sourceValue,
        uint256 sourceBase,
        uint256 targetBase,
        MathUpgradeable.Rounding rounding
    ) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        return sourceValue.mulDiv(targetBase, sourceBase, rounding);
    }
}
```
- there is a vulnerability in the` scaleByBases` function, The` mulDiv` function expects the first and third arguments to be the same type. the `targetBase` and `sourceBase` arguments are of type `uint256`, while the rounding argument is of type `MathUpgradeable``.Rounding`. This will cause a type error when the function is called.
The correct type for the rounding argument is `uint256`. This is because the `mulDiv` function expects the third argument to be a rounding mode. The `MathUpgradeable`.Rounding type is an `enum` that represents the different rounding modes, the `uint256` type can also be used to represent a rounding mode.
## Impact
- The vulnerability could cause the function to return incorrect results.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Change the type of the `rounding` argument to `uint256`, this will ensure that the `mulDiv` function can be called without any errors.
