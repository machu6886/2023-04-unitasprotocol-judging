# Dangerous arbitrary timestamp parameters may lead to inaccurate results.

## Summary
The functions `putPrice` and `updatePrices` controlled by the `FEEDER_ROLE` contain arbitrary timestamp values. These two functions are responsible for setting the current price or prices of an asset. As such the timestamp at which they are updates should be the current timestamp and nothing else. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Let us examine the function `putPrice`

```solidity

    function putPrice(address asset, uint64 timestamp, uint256 price) public onlyRole(FEEDER_ROLE) {
        uint64 prev_timestamp = prices[asset].timestamp;
        uint256 prev_price = prices[asset].price;
        require(prev_timestamp < timestamp, "Outdated timestamp"); //@audit update the price to block.timestamp
        prices[asset] = IOracle.Price(asset, timestamp, prev_timestamp, price, prev_price);
        emit newPrice(asset, timestamp, price);
    }
    
 ```
    
  The timestamp can be set to a time in the future, e.g (block.timestamp + 3 days ) which would be the incorrect putTimeStamp. 

## Impact

It is possible for the FEEDER to set a timestamp that is unrealistic or inaccurate rather than the correct timestamp.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I recommend mitigating the potential for an incorrect timestamp being applied by setting the value to the current time at which the function is called. Like so: 

```solidity

  function putPrice(address asset, uint256 price) public onlyRole(FEEDER_ROLE) {
        uint64 prev_timestamp = prices[asset].timestamp;
        uint256 prev_price = prices[asset].price;

        prices[asset] = IOracle.Price(asset, block.timeStamp, prev_timestamp, price, prev_price);
        emit newPrice(asset, timestamp, price);
    }
```

Additionally. with this implementation, there will be no need for this statement `require(prev_timestamp < block.timeStamp, "Outdated timestamp");` as `block.timeStamp will always be greater than `prev_timestamp `
