# The same pausing modifier for (USD1) is tied to minting, burning and transfer at the same time which breaks crucial invariants

## Summary
Users can't withdraw to `usdt` when `usd1` minting is paused


## Vulnerability Detail
The contract that Unitas uses for stables such as `USD1`, it uses the same pause modifier for the `minting, burning and transfer` functions. This does backfire due to their "invariants" according to their own risk management reserve ratio.

According to their  documentation, if the reserve ratio is below 130%, including below 100% too, the minting of USD1 will be paused until the reserve ratio is recovered, while allowing to still exchange usd1 for usdt (asset token).

When the minting of `usd1` is paused, the burning and transferring of `usd1` is paused too.

In the scenario of having to exchange `usd1` for `usdt`, which must be allowed at any time, due to the `usd1` contract being paused, it will fail.

This happens because as `usd1` is a "stable" type of asset inside Unitas contracts, it requires to be burned if you want to exchange it for an "Asset" type such as `usdt`

## Impact

Breaks crucial invariant where users can't withdraw to `usdt`.

## Recommendation
Do not tie the same pause modifier for every function in the "stable" assets contracts
