# Wrong logic in PoolBalances._receivePortfolio() will cause double loss of received amount of tokens

## Summary
There is wrong logic when setting portfolio in _receivePortfolio() function.

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem is in  _setPortfolio() which is used to set portfolio in _receivePortfolio() function.
```solidity
function _receivePortfolio(address token, address sender, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        AddressUtils.checkNotZero(token);
        AddressUtils.checkNotZero(sender);
        _checkAmountPositive(amount);
        _require(sender != address(this), Errors.SENDER_INVALID);

        uint256 portfolio = _getPortfolio(token);
        _require(amount <= portfolio, Errors.AMOUNT_INVALID);

        _setPortfolio(token, portfolio - amount);//@audit-info here the received `amount` is deducted from the prev portfolio bal

        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(sender, address(this), amount);

        emit PortfolioReceived(token, sender, amount);
```

The loss happens in two ways.

1. The received `amount` is unaccounted for when updating the portfolio balance via _setPortfolio(). So the amount of tokens received via the _receivePortfolio() function vanishes and is not updated in the portfolio mapping.
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) internal _portfolio;
```

2. The received `amount`  is deducted from previous Portfolio balance.
```solidity
 _setPortfolio(token, portfolio - amount);
```
Therefore received `amount` is lost  and prev portfolio  balance - `amount` is lost.

## Impact
The received `amount` vanishes and the prev portfolio balance gets deducted with `amount`.

thereby causing double loss of tokens

## Recommendation
add the received `amount` to  prev portfolio balance, don't deduct.
