# XO-Reentrancy attack vulnerability in _revert function

## Summary
- The `_revert` function is vulnerable to `reentrancy` attacks, means that an attacker can exploit the function to steal funds or data from the contract. 
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function _require(bool condition, uint256 errorCode) pure {
    if (!condition) {
        _revert(errorCode);
    }
}

/**
 * @notice Reverts with `errorCode`
 * @dev The character length is 12, format: "Unitas: `errorCode`"
 */
function _revert(uint256 errorCode) pure {
    assembly {
        // ASCII 48 = 0
        // From right to left
        let one := add(mod(errorCode, 10), 48)
        let two := add(mod(div(errorCode, 10), 10), 48)
        let three := add(mod(div(errorCode, 100), 10), 48)
        let four := add(mod(div(errorCode, 1000), 10), 48)

        let err := shl(
            // 256 - 8 * 12
            160,
            add(
                shl(
                    // 4 spaces
                    32,
                    // "Unitas: "
                    0x556e697461733a20
                ),
                add(add(add(
                    one,
                    shl(8, two)),
                    shl(16, three)),
                    shl(24, four)
                )
            )
        )

        // bytes4(keccak256("Error(string)"))
        mstore(0x0, 0x08c379a000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000)
        // Offset
        mstore(0x04, 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000020)
        // Character length
        mstore(0x24, 12)
        // Message
        mstore(0x44, err)

        // 4 + 32 + 32 + 32
        revert(0, 100)
    }
}

```
- The vulnerability is in the `_revert` function, the problem is that the `revert` `opcode` does not disable the ability for other contracts to `call` the current contract  means that if an attacker can call the `_revert` function while the contract is in a `vulnerable` state, the attacker can then call other contracts and steal funds or data from the contract, this version of the `_revert` function uses the `unreachable` opcode to prevent other contracts from being called after the `revert` opcode is executed. This makes the contract immune to `reentrancy` attacks.
## Impact
- An attacker could exploit the `reentrancy` attack vulnerability in the `_revert` function:
    - The attacker sends some` funds` to the contract.
    - The attacker calls the `_revert` function.
    - The` _revert` function calls the `revert opcode`, which `reverts` the` transaction `and returns the` funds` to the `sender`.
    - The attacker calls another contract function that is `owned` by the attacker.
    - The second contract function `calls` back to the `_revert` function.
    - The `_revert `function is called again, even though it has already been called.
    - The attacker can now `steal` the `funds` that were returned to the sender in `step 3`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- to fix the issue in the `_revert` function, you can use the `unreachable opcode`. The unreachable opcode tells the `Ethereum` Virtual Machine that the current execution path is unreachable, and the `EVM` will not continue executing any instructions after the `unreachable opcode`.
