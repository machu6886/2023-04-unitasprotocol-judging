# Users can frontrun approve and decreaseAllowance functions

## Summary

With a current implementation on ERC20Token contract there is possibility to frontrun users that want to change their approvals for spenders. 

## Vulnerability Detail

For example, Alice has 200 tokens. She approved Bob to spend 100 of her tokens. Later she changed her mind and decided to decrease allowance to 50 tokens. However Bob saw her transaction in the mempool and send two of his transactions frontruning her: the first one is to transfer 100 tokens and later to transfer 50 tokens. Finaly he end up with 150 tokens, but Alice wanted him to spens less. 

## Impact

A protocol user can spend more tokens than he expected due to a a frontrun attact by a maliciuos user.

```solidity
  function _approve(
        address owner,
        address spender,
        uint256 amount
    ) internal virtual {
        require(owner != address(0), "ERC20: approve from the zero address");
        require(spender != address(0), "ERC20: approve to the zero address");

        _allowances[owner][spender] = amount;
        emit Approval(owner, spender, amount);
    }
```

## Recommendation

It's recommended to set an approval to zero before changing it to another value.
