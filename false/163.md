# The reserve ratio can be pushed even lower than a 100%  by front-running "pause" EMC minting

## Summary
The reserve ratio can be pushed even lower than a 100% by front-running "pause" EMC minting

## Vulnerability Detail
When the Reserve ratio is below â‰¤ 100% the protocol is expected to pause all minting permanently (until the ratio is recovered).

As they have to stop all of the mintings from all the EMCs ( all the coins/stables at a time), you can front-run the pause method from any of these stables and decrease the reserve ratio even more.

Attack:

1 -Reserve ratio reaches 100%
2- Protocol starts pausing the EMCs (stables)
3- Attacker front-runs the pause function from any of those stables and swaps `usd1` for any stables
4- Attacker has increased liabilities and decreased more the ratio even if they reached the < 100% ratio beforehand



## Impact

The reserve ratio can be pushed even lower than a 100% while pausing all the EMCs, causing more liabilities for the protocol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a specific function in the codebase to pause all the EMCs at the same time and use flashbots to trigger it once the reserve ratio threshlod is reached.
