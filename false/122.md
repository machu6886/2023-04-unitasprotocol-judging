# `executeBatch()` could fail due to unbounded array

## Summary
In `TimelockController.sol` the function `executeBatch`, could revert if the array of orders is too big.
## Vulnerability Detail
To call [`executeBatch()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/TimelockController.sol#L313-L334) first governance needs to [`scheduleBatch()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/TimelockController.sol#L230-L249). The issue is that `scheduleBatch()` could schedule much more operations, because it only emits an event in the for loop

```jsx
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets.length; ++i) {
            emit CallScheduled(id, i, targets[i], values[i], payloads[i], predecessor, delay);
        }
```
Unlike [`executeBatch()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/TimelockController.sol#L326-L331), where it iterates and calls `_execute()` which is much more gas heavy
```jsx
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets.length; ++i) {
            address target = targets[i];
            uint256 value = values[i];
            bytes calldata payload = payloads[i];
            _execute(target, value, payload);
            emit CallExecuted(id, i, target, value, payload);
        }
```
## Impact
Some orders won't be executable and governance needs to schedule them again!
## Code Snippet
```jsx
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < targets.length; ++i) {//@audit could fail on multiple gas heavy orders
            address target = targets[i];
            uint256 value = values[i];
            bytes calldata payload = payloads[i];
            _execute(target, value, payload);
            emit CallExecuted(id, i, target, value, payload);
        }
```

## Recommendation
Check for length on the batch orders.
