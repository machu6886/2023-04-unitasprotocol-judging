# XO-revokeGovernor function allows attacker to continue to act as governor

## Summary
- The vulnerability in the  `revokeGovernor` function it does not actually `revoke` the old governor, it simply checks to see if the old `governor` is equal to the current `governor`. If they are equal, the function does nothing, the function reverts.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
*/
interface IERC20Token is IERC20Metadata {
    function GOVERNOR_ROLE() external view returns (bytes32);
    function GUARDIAN_ROLE() external view returns (bytes32);
    function MINTER_ROLE() external view returns (bytes32);
    function setGovernor(address newGovernor, address oldGovernor) external;
    function revokeGovernor(address oldGovernor) external;
    function setGuardian(address newGuardian, address oldGuardian) external;
    function revokeGuardian(address oldGuardian) external;
    function setMinter(address newMinter, address oldMinter) external;
    function revokeMinter(address oldMinter) external;
    function pause() external;
    function unpause() external;
    function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external;
    function burn(address burner, uint256 amount) external;
    function addBlackList(address evilUser) external;
    function removeBlackList(address clearedUser) external;

}
```
- There is a vulnerability in interface `IERC20Token` so the real problem is in the `revokeGovernor` function, this function does not actually `revoke` the old `governor`, it simply checks to see if the old `governor` is equal to the current `governor`. If they are equal, the function does nothing. Otherwise, the function `reverts`, This is vulnerability  it allows an attacker to continue to act as` governor` even after they have been `revoked` so The attacker can do this by simply creating a new account that is equal to the address of the old `governor`, the attacker can then use this new account to call the `revokeGovernor` function, and the function will do nothing.
## Impact
- This vulnerability allows an attacker to continue to act as `governor` even after they have been `revoked`. the attacker can do this by simply creating a new account that is equal to the address of the `old governor`. The attacker can then use this new account to call the `revokeGovernor` function, and the function will do nothing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- adding a check to the `revokeGovernor` function to make sure that the old governor is not equal to the address of `0x0` or the address of the current `sender`.
