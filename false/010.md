# Insufficient newDelay value validation can stuck the protocol

## Summary

Insufficient newDelay value validation can stuck the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

 _minDelay is a value that responds for the time period when core protocol functions can be executed.  And TimelockController is the only role that can update the _minDelay.  The only require check here is 

`require(msg.sender == address(this), "TimelockController: caller must be timelock");` 

so if the newDelay value will be misspelled and updated, the time period for other functions' execution can be too big. Also there is no chance to update the value in emergency case. So core functions can stuck for a long period of time. 

## Impact

The protocol will not be able to execute core functions.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/TimelockController.sol#L370

```solidity
    function updateDelay(uint256 newDelay) external virtual {
        require(msg.sender == address(this), "TimelockController: caller must be timelock");
        emit MinDelayChange(_minDelay, newDelay);
        _minDelay = newDelay;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Provide an additional checks to a newDeleay value to let it be not bigger or not less than a specific time in future.
