# XO-getLatestPrice function allows attacker to get price of non-existent asset.

## Summary
- The `getLatestPrice` function  does not check to make sure that the asset is a valid `ERC20` token. This means that an attacker could call this function with an address that does not refer to a valid `ERC20` token, and the function would succeed, even though the asset is not a valid `ERC20` token.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function getLatestPrice(address asset) external view returns (uint256 price);

    // Struct of main contract XOracle
    struct Price{
        address asset;
        uint64 timestamp;
        uint64 prev_timestamp;
        uint256 price;
        uint256 prev_price;
    }

    struct NewPrice{
        address asset;
        uint64 timestamp;
        uint256 price;
    }
}
```
- There is a vulnerability in the interface `IOracle`, in the `getLatestPrice` function does not check to make sure that the asset is a valid `ERC20` token. This means that an attacker could call this function with an address that does not refer to a valid `ERC20` token, and the function would succeed, even though the asset is not a valid `ERC20` token.
## Impact
- The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who calls the `getLatestPrice` function with an address that does not refer to a valid `ERC20` token.
- This vulnerability  allows an attacker to get the `price` of an asset that does not exist.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- adding a check to the `getLatestPrice` function to make sure that the asset is a valid` ERC20` token.
