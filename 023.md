# Denial of Service Attack via Gas Limit in _getTotalReservesAndCollaterals() and _getTotalLiabilities()

## Summary

The `_getTotalReservesAndCollaterals()` and _`getTotalLiabilities()` functions in the given contract may be vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack due to its reliance on a loop that iterates based on `tokenCount`. If `tokenCount` is too large, the function could exceed the transaction gas limit, causing the function to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
 In the `_getTotalReservesAndCollaterals()` function, a for loop iterates over a number of tokens given by tokenCount. Within this loop, various operations including external calls to `oracle.getLatestPrice(token)` are made. If tokenCount is very large, the cumulative gas required for all these operations could exceed the block gas limit, causing the transaction to fail.

As the block size limit is 30 millions nowadays and assuming the rough estimate of 100,000 gas used per iteration in the `_getTotalReservesAndCollaterals()` function, and the swap() function (excluding the `_getTotalReservesAndCollaterals()` part) uses around 4 million gas, you'd now be left with about 26 million gas for the `_getTotalReservesAndCollaterals()`  and the `_getTotalLiabilities()` loops

With each iteration using about 100,000 gas, you'd hit the new block gas limit at roughly 100 tokens (`tokenCount = 100`).

## Impact

The problem is that these functions are called on the last operation from a `swap()` call, that's why I submitted it.
In case of DOS due to a too large number of tokens on the protocol the swap function could become out of service preventing any user to swap any tokens, due to the large number of tokens that this protocol would need to implement I submit this findings as medium

```solidity
    //E Main function of this protocol => _CheckReserveRatio() => _getTotalReservesAndCollaterals()
    function swap(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, AmountType amountType, uint256 amount)
        external whenNotPaused  nonReentrant   returns (uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOut)
    {
       ....
        _checkReserveRatio(tokenOut == pair.baseToken ? pair.buyReserveRatioThreshold : pair.sellReserveRatioThreshold);
    }
    function _checkReserveRatio(uint232 reserveRatioThreshold) internal view {

            (ReserveStatus reserveStatus, uint256 reserveRatio) = _getReserveStatus(allReserves, liabilities);
           ....
    }
    function _getTotalReservesAndCollaterals() internal view returns (uint256 reserves, uint256 collaterals) {
        address baseToken = address(tokenManager.usd1());
        uint8 tokenTypeValue = uint8(ITokenManager.TokenType.Asset);
        uint256 tokenCount = tokenManager.tokenLength(tokenTypeValue);
        uint256 priceBase = 10 ** oracle.decimals();

        for (uint256 i; i < tokenCount; i++) {
            ...
        }
    }
function _getTotalLiabilities() internal view returns (uint256 liabilities) {
        address baseToken = address(tokenManager.usd1());
        uint8 tokenTypeValue = uint8(ITokenManager.TokenType.Stable);
        uint256 tokenCount = tokenManager.tokenLength(tokenTypeValue);
        uint256 priceBase = 10 ** oracle.decimals();

        for (uint256 i; i < tokenCount; i++) {

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a strict limit to the number of tokens that can be submit (ie 100 per example)
Another approach is to optimize the gas consumption by minimizing the number of operations and external calls within the loop. Indeed you could merge both functions to do only one loop and improving the "MaxTokenCount" ratio to 200
