# Failure to handle return values in `insurancePool.sol`

## Summary
The return value of IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom() is not checked. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The return value of IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom() is not checked. While the ERC20 standard does not specify return values for transfer functions, many actual implementations do return a boolean value indicating success. It could lead to a failed transfer without the contract noticing.

## Impact
An ERC20 token that returns false on safeTransferFrom() could lead to a failed transfer without the contract noticing.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Handles the return value of safeTransferFrom.
e.g 
```solidity
bool transferSuccessful = IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
require(transferSuccessful, "Token transfer failed");
```
