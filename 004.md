# Incorrect Order of Operations in depositCollateral Function

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
The `depositCollateral` function in the smart contract currently updates the balance of the token before the `safeTransferFrom` call. 

This means that the balance is updated even before it's confirmed that the tokens have been successfully transferred. 

If the safeTransferFrom call fails for any reason (for example, if the sender doesn't have enough tokens), the transaction will be reverted, but the balance stored in the contract would be incorrect because it was updated before the transfer was confirmed.

## Impact
The balance is updated before the safeTransferFrom call. If the safeTransferFrom call fails, the balance in the contract will be incorrect because it was increased even though no tokens were transferred

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
move the _setBalance line after the safeTransferFrom line:
```solidity
...
IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
 _setBalance(token, _getBalance(token) + amount);
...
```
