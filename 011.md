# WithdrawCollateral's flawed mechanic vulnerable to DoS

## Summary
When users call `swap`, it executes `_swapOut`, and if there are not enough funds in the swap contract, it calls `insurancePool.withdrawCollateral()` to withdraw some funds from the investments, which can lead to a revert on  `withdrawCollateral()`

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `withdrawCollateral()` has a peculiar mechanism for calculating the allowed withdrawal amounts. In the following line, you can see that the amount to be withdrawn must be smaller than `collateral` (which represents the amount of money in the contract) minus `_getPortfolio()` (which represents the amount of money invested away). However, [`_getPortfolio()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/InsurancePool.sol#L102) is not necessary for this calculation and causes issues.

```jsx
_require(collateral - _getPortfolio(token) >= amount, Errors.POOL_BALANCE_INSUFFICIENT);
``` 

Here's an example scenario illustrating the issue:

  - Portfolio (investment in crv) is 5000 USD
  - Collateral is only 5200 USD
  - User wants to withdraw 300 USD

In this case, we can provide 300 USD to the user, but the function will revert because of the condition:
```jsx
 _require(5200 - 5000 >= 300)
```
Owners can call the `TimelockController` contract and withdraw some investments back into the pool to enable users to withdraw. However, this needs to be done manually by the multisig, and users need to wait 24-48 hours for the timelock to finish. Because it is not a permanent lock, I am classifying it as a medium-level issue.

## Impact
Faulty logic in `InsurancePool.withdrawCollateral()` could revert leading to DoS.
## Code Snippet
[`withdrawCollateral()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/InsurancePool.sol#L98-L109)
```jsx
   function withdrawCollateral(address token, uint256 amount) external onlyGuardianOrWithdrawer nonReentrant {
        _checkAmountPositive(amount);// require(amount > 0)

        uint256 collateral = _getBalance(token);
        //@audit why _getPortfolio() ?
        _require(collateral - _getPortfolio(token) >= amount, Errors.POOL_BALANCE_INSUFFICIENT);

        _setBalance(token, collateral - amount);

        IERC20(token).safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount);

        emit CollateralWithdrawn(token, msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent this add:
```jsx
 -   _require(collateral - _getPortfolio(token) >= amount, Errors.POOL_BALANCE_INSUFFICIENT);
 +   _require(collateral >= amount, Errors.POOL_BALANCE_INSUFFICIENT);
```
