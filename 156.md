# Lack of Input Validation can Permanently DOS Oracle

## Summary
In `XOracle.sol`, the prices for each asset are updated via the `putPrice()` function from the `FEEDER_ROLE`. The input price and timestamp overwrite the existing data in the `prices` mapping for the particular assets. The function contains a check that the existing `prices[asset].timestamp` is less than the input `timestamp`, otherwise it reverts. This creates an interesting possibility for the contract to DOS itself if an input `timestamp` is accidently set too far in the future. The `FEEDER` will not be able to update the price again until the existing timestamp has passed the current `block.timestamp`.

*It is possible for the FEEDER to simply update the price with an even larger input timestamp, but that would require inputting an even more incorrect `timestamp`.*

## Vulnerability Detail
The `putPrice()` function only allows updating an asset price/timestamp if the input `timestamp` is less than the asset's timestamp in storage. There is no validation that the input `timestamp` is less than or equal to `block.timestamp` to protect against inputting a `timestamp` too far in the future.

## Impact
- Inability to update asset prices without further adding to the incorrect future timestamp discrepancy.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add another check that the input `timestamp` is less than or equal to `block.timestamp`.

```solidity
    function putPrice(address asset, uint64 timestamp, uint256 price) public onlyRole(FEEDER_ROLE) {
        uint64 prev_timestamp = prices[asset].timestamp;
        uint256 prev_price = prices[asset].price;
        require(prev_timestamp < timestamp, "Outdated timestamp");
++      require(timestamp <= block.timestamp, "No future timestamps");
        prices[asset] = IOracle.Price(asset, timestamp, prev_timestamp, price, prev_price);
        emit newPrice(asset, timestamp, price);
    }
```
