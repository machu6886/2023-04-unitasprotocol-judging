# Price tolerance can break protocol if USDT depegs.

## Summary
Unitas implements a price range that causes swaps to revert if the price deviates from it. If USDT depegs that will cause all the funds to be locked up until the value is updated.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the price deviates from the expected range, the protocol reverts when swapping:

```sol
    function _checkPrice(address quoteToken, uint256 price) internal view {
        (uint256 minPrice, uint256 maxPrice) = tokenManager.getPriceTolerance(quoteToken);

        _require(minPrice > 0 && maxPrice > 0, Errors.PRICE_TOLERANCE_INVALID);
        _require(minPrice <= price && price <= maxPrice, Errors.PRICE_INVALID);
    }
```

To update the price range you have to go through the timelock first:
```sol
    function setMinMaxPriceTolerance(address token, uint256 minPrice, uint256 maxPrice) external onlyTimelock {
        _setMinMaxPriceTolerance(token, minPrice, maxPrice);
    }
```

Depegs can occur in a very short time at any point as seen with the recent depegging of USDC. In a matter of 1-2 hours, it went from $1 to $0.9.
Until the protocol team reacts and passes the change through the timelock, the damage will be done already. Any user of Unitas will be left with worthless tokens since they weren't able to access their assets.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The price data comes from your own oracle. If the underlying asset depegs, you should still allow trading with that price. Instead of using the price range to prevent bad prices from affecting the system, you should secure your oracle contract.
