# Unhandled Re-Entrancy Vulnerability

## Summary

In the given contract code `Unitas.sol`, a potential re-entrancy vulnerability exists in the `swap` function. This function has the `nonReentrant` modifier from the `ReentrancyGuardUpgradeable` contract, but it's used after calling external contracts, which may lead to a re-entrancy attack. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The `swap` function allows a token holder to swap their tokens with another token. However, the function calls the `_swapIn` and `_swapOut` methods, which are further making external calls to other contracts (`IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom` and `IERC20(token).safeTransfer` or `IERC20Token(token).mint` and `IERC20Token(token).burn`). These external calls can potentially be a point of re-entrancy if the called contract has malicious code. Since the `nonReentrant` modifier is used after these external calls, it does not protect against re-entrancy attacks.

## Impact

Re-entrancy attacks can allow an attacker to withdraw more than their balance from the contract or perform actions multiple times in a single transaction. This could result in substantial financial loss or disrupt the proper operation of the contract.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function swap(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, AmountType amountType, uint256 amount)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOut)
{
    IERC20Token feeToken;
    uint256 fee;
    uint24 feeNumerator;
    uint256 price;
    ITokenManager.PairConfig memory pair = tokenManager.getPair(tokenIn, tokenOut);

    (amountIn, amountOut, feeToken, fee, feeNumerator, price) = _getSwapResult(pair, tokenIn, tokenOut, amountType, amount);

    _require(IERC20(tokenIn).balanceOf(msg.sender) >= amountIn, Errors.BALANCE_INSUFFICIENT);

    _swapIn(tokenIn, msg.sender, amountIn);

    _swapOut(tokenOut, msg.sender, amountOut);

    // ...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To avoid re-entrancy attacks, it is recommended to use checks-effects-interactions pattern where you first make any changes to your contract's state, then call the external function. Furthermore, ensure the `nonReentrant` modifier is placed at the appropriate point to effectively guard against potential re-entrancy.

## Proof Of Concept

1. Deploy a malicious contract that implements the `IERC20` interface. Inside the `transferFrom` function of the malicious contract, call the `swap` function of the `Unitas` contract.
2. Call the `swap` function of the `Unitas` contract, supplying the malicious contract's address as `tokenIn`.
3. The `swap` function will call `_swapIn`, which will call the malicious contract's `transferFrom` function, which will again call `swap` in `Unitas`. Because the `nonReentrant` modifier is placed after the external calls, this re-entrance is not prevented.
