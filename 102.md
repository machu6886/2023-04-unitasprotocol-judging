# Incorrect `price` returned in `_getSwapResult` for `USDT/USD1`

## Summary

Incorrect `price` returned in `_getSwapResult` for `USDT/USD1`

## Vulnerability Detail
[Price when `priceQuoteToken` is `tokenIn` ](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/Unitas.sol#L463) is calculated as `price = request.priceBase * request.priceBase / price;`, but this stands true only for tokens with same decimals places. Assuming usdt is eqaul do usd1, when `tokenIn=usdt`, and `tokenOut=usd1`, the result is that `priceQuoteToken` is `usdt`, `priceBase` is 1e18, and price is `1e18`. 
But the `priceBase` of usdt should be `1e6`(that doesn't matter because `priceBase` is not used anywhere after `_calculateSwapResult`), and the price should be `1e6`.
The result is that the [event](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/Unitas.sol#L236) price is emitted incorrectly.

## Impact

Incorrect price calculated, and the wrong event emitted.

## Code Snippet
current code look like this
```solidity
    if (tokenIn == priceQuoteToken) {
            // The base currency of oracle price is USD1, inverts the price when buying USD1
            price = request.priceBase * request.priceBase / price;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Correct code should look like this
```solidity
 if (tokenIn == priceQuoteToken) {
      // The base currency of oracle price is USD1, inverts the price when buying USD1
     price = IERC20Token(tokenIn).decimals() * request.priceBase / price;
  }
```
