# The mutability of roles in `Unitas.sol` renders their utility ineffective. Therefore roles become useless.

## Summary
The mutability of roles in `Unitas.sol` renders their utility ineffective. Therefore roles become useless.
Similarly, the role definitions in `ERC20Token.sol`, `InsurancePool.sol`, `TimelockController.sol`, `TokenManager.sol`, and `XOracle.sol` are equally mutable, thus their intended use is compromised.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently creating `Unitas.sol` contract, the contract necessitates the allocation of specific roles, such as `GOVERNOR_ROLE`, `GUARDIAN_ROLE`, `TIMELOCK_ROLE`, and `PORTFOLIO_ROLE`. The design implies that only users holding these particular roles have the ability to execute certain functions. For instance, only a user bearing the `GUARDIAN_ROLE` can trigger `pause()` and `unpause()` functions in the `Unitas.sol` contract.
Similarly, in the `ERC20Token.sol` contract, only a user holding the `MINTER_ROLE` can activate `mint()` and `burn()` functions. There are various such instances.

This kind of attack/abuse is currently hard to track. There is no centralized database of created editions and their admins at the time of creations (i.e. a mapping). This makes it hard to track down malicious creators who create editions for other people.
Looping through the emitted events and comparing current admins to the emitted admins is a hassle especially if this protocol gains a lot of traction in the future which I assume is the end goal here.

## Impact
Take, for example, the `ERC20Token.sol` contract and the `MINTER_ROLE`. A potential bypass to the system's design can be a `malicious` minter creating an edition for an individual who doesnâ€™t possess the `MINTER_ROLE`, by creating the edition and granting the `MINTER_ROLE` to the non-minter using the `AccessControl.sol` `grantRole()` function. This way the non-minter can revoke the original minter role in this edition and gain full ownership. Now this non-minter user can execute `mint()` and `burn()` functions.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `ERC20Token.sol`, `InsurancePool.sol`, `TimelockController.sol`, `TokenManager.sol` and `XOracle.sol` implementations contracts, it is recommended to override the grantRole() function of `AccessControl.sol` with something like:

![grantRole](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol-radeveth/assets/88380154/b5ac91cf-5307-4424-8535-b1f5f3b41764)

Do the same thing for `Unitas.sol` implementation contract with grantRole() function of `AccessControlUpgradeable.sol`.
