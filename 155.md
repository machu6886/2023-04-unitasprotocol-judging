# Unconditional EMC => usd1 swap will fail if reserve ratio â‰¤ 100%

## Summary
The unconditional EMC => usd1 swap will fail if reserve ratio goes below 100%

## Vulnerability Detail
The burn of any EMC, such as `usd91` is unconditional according to the docs. In the case, an EMC has to be swapped (burned) for `usd1` in a ratio below 100%, the swap will fail due to the EMC being paused.

As you can see, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol-0xffff11/tree/main/Unitas-Protocol#reserve-ratio--100   if the reserve ratio is below 100% they pause all type of mintings

## Impact
Unable to swap back EMCs to `usd1` below a 100% reserve ratio
