# Reserve Ratio is wrongly calculated

## Summary

Reserve Ratio is wrongly calculated, protocol may not be able to pay liabilities in full.

## Vulnerability Detail

The equation for calculating Reserve Ratio is:

> Reserve Ratio = Total Reserve / Total Liability

`Total Reserve` is the total Asset (USDT) balance controlled by Unitas contract and InsurancePool contract, and `Total Liability` is total minted Stable (USD1, USDEMC) value, the same can be seen in [_getTotalReservesAndCollaterals()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/Unitas.sol#L500) function and [_getTotalLiabilities()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/Unitas.sol#L540) function:

When calculating `Total Reserve`, protocols obtains [_balance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/PoolBalances.sol#L22) of Unitas contract and InsurancePool contract:
```solidity
    mapping(address => uint256) internal _balance;
```
A portion of `_balance` goes to Curve/Aave/Balancer etc to generate yield, this part of value is stored in [_portfolio](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/PoolBalances.sol#L26):
```solidity
    mapping(address => uint256) internal _portfolio;
```
We can see that `Total Reserve` contains `_portfolio` and `_portfolio` is fed to the `Reserve Ratio` calculation. However, when user redeems, there may not be enough Asset for withdrawl.

Imagine a situation where the `_balance` of Unitas contract and InsurancePool contract is 1000 USDT and 300 USDT, the `_portfolio`of InsurancePool is 100 USDT,  `Total Liability` is 1000 USD1, and `Reserve Ratio` is 130%. 

If USDEMC appreciates upto 21%,  `Total Liability` will be 1210 USD1, and `Reserve Ratio` is 108%, It may seem that protocol can still pay liabilities in full, but it is not. 

Firstly, all the 1000 USDT in Unitas contract will be utilized, then 210 USDT needs to be obtained from InsurancePool protocol, unfortunately, the total USDT in InsurancePool contract is only 200 USDT because the 100 USDT `_portfolio` is not in the contract, the shortage is 10 USDT and protocol fails to pay liabilities.

## Impact

Reserve Ratio is wrongly calculated, protocol may not be able to pay liabilities in full.

## Recommendation

Please consider to exclude `_portfolio` from the `Reserve Ratio` calculation.
