## Recommendation

Giving authority for the token holder for his own funds by allowing 
use this instead

function burn( uint256 amount) external  whenNotPaused notBlacklisted(msg.sender) { 
        require(amount != 0, "Invalid amount");
        require(amount <= balanceOf(msg.sender),"not enough tokens to burn");
        _burn(msg.sender, amount);
        emit Burn(msg.sender, amount);
    }
