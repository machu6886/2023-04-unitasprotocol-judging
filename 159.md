# lack of receive _Balance logic in contract PoolBalances.sol

## Summary
lack of receive _Balance logic in contract PoolBalances.sol
## Vulnerability Detail
in the contract poolbalances.sol we have two mappings 

```solidity 
   mapping(address => uint256) internal _balance;
    
    mapping(address => uint256) internal _portfolio;
```
we have receive for _portfoilo to update the portfolio mapping for receives but not for _balance mapping 

```solidity
 function _receivePortfolio(address token, address sender, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
```
## Impact
we need it for updating after receiving balance 
## Code Snippet

```solidity
 function _receivePortfolio(address token, address sender, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
```
