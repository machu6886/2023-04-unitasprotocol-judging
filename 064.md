# Not check getLatestPrice value threshold

## Summary

In some cases, `_checkPrice` is called to check the price threshold, but in some cases not.  

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
        address priceQuoteToken = _getPriceQuoteToken(tokenIn, tokenOut);
        price = oracle.getLatestPrice(priceQuoteToken);
        _checkPrice(priceQuoteToken, price);


        // @audit not check price threshold
        uint256 price = oracle.getLatestPrice(token);

        reserves += _convert(
            token,
            baseToken,
            tokenReserve,
            MathUpgradeable.Rounding.Down,
            price,
            priceBase,
            token
        );
```

The `getLatestPrice` is used in three places. The `priceQuoteToken` was checked, but `_getTotalReservesAndCollaterals` and `_getTotalLiabilities` not.   
This means that when the price of some other quoteToken that is not a swap target fluctuates dramatically, the protocol does not sense that it is still functioning normally if the reverse ratio is within the threshold

## Impact

The price given by oracle may exceed the threshold, which means that the token value fluctuates wildly and should reject swap.
