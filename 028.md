# Executor can misuse deposited ETH in TimelockController for the execution.

## Summary
Executor can misuse deposited ETH in TimelockController for the execution.

## Vulnerability Detail
- The TimelockController contract allows ETH deposits for maintenance purposes. However, it's possible that this ETH amount may get front-runned by executors who will execute and not pay msg.value for the execution (and instead use the deposited ETH).

## Impact
- Deposited ETH may get misused for non-expected purposes.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Check the msg.value paid is equal to the value to be used (or sum of values to be used for batch executions)
