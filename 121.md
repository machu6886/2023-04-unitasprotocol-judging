# Protocol mints fee, instead of subtracting it from the user, causing infaltion

## Summary
Protocol mint's fee, instead of subtracting it from the user. This increases `totalsupply` and inflates it for all users, not just the minter.
## Vulnerability Detail
In `Unitas.sol` under [`swap`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/Unitas.sol#L208) the protocol calculates the fee and them mints tokens to the protocol. This is inflationary behavior that punishes all users, since it increases the `totalSupply` of the token. It also doesn't damage that much the original user that called `swap`, since his conversion is not effected.
```jsx
     if (fee > 0) {
         address feeReceiver = surplusPool;
         feeToken.mint(feeReceiver, fee);
         emit SwapFeeSent(address(feeToken), feeReceiver, fee);
     }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The function should take out the fee from the original conversion in `swapOut`. Lower the `amountOut`, by the fee.
