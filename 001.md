# Protocol does not check for price staleness from the XOracle, which is problematic if the price feeder goes down.

## Summary

The protocol uses an XOracle model, which is an Oracle that is updated by the protocol itself in an automated fashion, using whichever account with the `FEEDER_ROLE`.

The XOracle does not perform a price staleness check whenever an operation is performed. This puts the price feeder to be a single point of failure. Price staleness can lead to bad mintings and therefore bad debt for the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

Note that both functions to fetch the price has no staleness check.

```solidity
function getPrice(address asset) public view returns (uint64, uint64, uint256, uint256) {
    return (
        prices[asset].timestamp,
        prices[asset].prev_timestamp,
        prices[asset].price,
        prices[asset].prev_price
    );
}

function getLatestPrice(address asset) public view returns (uint256) {
    return prices[asset].price;
}
```

Neither does the protocol use the function `getPrice()` anywhere. The function `getLatestPrice()` does not return the price timestamp information, therefore the protocol does not validate price timestamp anywhere.

This means that the protocol will keep using the latest price without regards to its freshness. There are many possible scenarios in which a price feeder can go down (e.g. internet connection, server down, RPC endpoint down, etc.), and given that it runs in an automated fashion, such scenarios can cause the feeder go down for an extended period without human intervention.

## Impact

The price feeder is now a single point of failure. If the feeder goes down due to any external reasons and the price does not get updated, the price may significantly deviate from the market, incurring bad debt for the protocol.

This is also why Chainlink recommends price staleness check, even when fetching price from its own oracles.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The main point is to validate the price timestamp before any operation. There are two ways that one can validate the price:
- The main protocol should not use `getLatestPrice()` from the XOracle, but rather `getPrice()`, and properly validate all of the information, including the timestamp.
- Implement a function `getPriceNoLaterThan(address asset, uint256 age)`, which also returns price just like `getLatestPrice()`, but reverts if the price is older than `age`.
