# USDT can introduce fee on transfer

## Summary

In contest details, protocol state they plan to exclusively use USDT as a stable asset in a first phase. They also state not to support fee on transfer tokens. However, USDT implements the possibility of adding fee on transfers. The protocol will be broken if USDT decides to add fee on transfers.

> Which ERC20 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts? -> USDT

> Are there any FEE-ON-TRANSFER tokens interacting with the smart contracts? -> No

## Vulnerability Detail

USDT code on mainnet implements fee on transfer: https://etherscan.io/token/0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7#code

```solidity
    function transfer(address _to, uint _value) public onlyPayloadSize(2 * 32) {
        uint fee = (_value.mul(basisPointsRate)).div(10000);
        if (fee > maximumFee) {
            fee = maximumFee;
        }
        uint sendAmount = _value.sub(fee);
        balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(_value);
        balances[_to] = balances[_to].add(sendAmount);
        if (fee > 0) {
            balances[owner] = balances[owner].add(fee);
            Transfer(msg.sender, owner, fee);
        }
        Transfer(msg.sender, _to, sendAmount);
    }
```

The value for `basisPointsRate` is currently 0 but can be changed at any time by the USDT owner.

Fee on transfer are not taken into consideration in `Unitas.sol` as for USDT the token type is `Asset` and the balance is increased by `amount` while `amount - fees` is actually received:

```solidity
    function _swapIn(address token, address spender, uint256 amount) internal {
        ITokenManager.TokenType tokenType = tokenManager.getTokenType(token);

        require(tokenType != ITokenManager.TokenType.Undefined);

        if (tokenType == ITokenManager.TokenType.Asset) {
            _setBalance(token, _getBalance(token) + amount);
            IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(spender, address(this), amount);
        } else {
            IERC20Token(token).burn(spender, amount);
        }
    }
```

It is also not taken into account in `SwapFunctions.sol` as the swap calculation assume they receive the full amount in when token is USDT and assume user receives the full amount when token out is USDT. There is no consideration regarding the potential fees on USDT transfers.

Accounting of reserves will also be broken when sending / receiving USDT with fee on transfer for portfolio management:

## Impact

Assuming there is a fee on transfer set on USDT as some point:
- swapping from USDT to USD1 will mint `x` USD1 while protocol received `x - fees`
- swapping back from USD1 to USDT will send `x` USDT back to user
- over time `Unitas.sol` will become insolvent

Regarding reserves and portfolio management:
- protocol will believe it holds more assets than in reality due to accounting error when sending / receiving portfolio
- insurance provider will lose money over time via portfolio management
- over time whole protocol will become insolvent

When protocol is insolvent some users may not be able to exit the protocol by swapping USD_EMC -> USD1 -> USDT resulting in a loss of funds for them.

## Recommendation

Use a stable coin with no possibility of fee on transfer, or take into account the eventual fee by comparing the balance of the contract before and after any USDT transfer.
