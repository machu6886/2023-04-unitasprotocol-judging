# Missing deadline checks in token `swap` function

## Summary

Missing deadline checks in token `swap` function

## Vulnerability Detail

The token swap function in the `Unitas` contract does not include a deadline check. This omission can allow transactions to be executed in unfavorable conditions or be maliciously exploited, especially in the context of Miner Extractable Value (MEV).

## Impact

Users might unknowingly perform trades that are disadvantageous to them if market conditions change dramatically after the transaction has been broadcasted but before it is included in a block. Additionally, miners or any privileged entities could manipulate the order of transactions to benefit from user trades. Both scenarios could lead to a loss of funds for users.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/Unitas.sol/#L208-L237
```solidity
function swap(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, AmountType amountType, uint256 amount)
    external
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
    returns (uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOut)
{
...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a deadline check in the swap function. The users should be able to specify a deadline as a parameter, after which their transaction should not be able to be executed. This can protect users from significant price changes or potential MEV exploitation. An example of a deadline check is as follows:

```solidity
function swap(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, AmountType amountType, uint256 amount, uint256 deadline)
    external
    whenNotPaused
    nonReentrant
    returns (uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOut)
{
    require(block.timestamp <= deadline, "transaction expired");
    ...
}
```
In this example, `block.timestamp` is used to compare with the user-provided deadline. If the current block timestamp is later than the `deadline`, the transaction will be reverted with a message indicating that it has expired.
