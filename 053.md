# decreaseAllowance has modifier `notBlacklisted(spender)`, which stops other users who would like to revoke allowance to a black-listed address

## Summary
decreaseAllowance has modifier `notBlacklisted(spender)`, which stops other users who would like to revoke allowance to a black-listed address

## Vulnerability Detail
In ERC20Token implementation, there is a blacklist in wihch addresses are forbidden to be sender/receiver of tokens. It also cannot be recipient nor approver of allowance. However, other users who have previously approved some allowance to this blacklisted address, might want to revoke their allowance now, but cannot do so since decreaseAllowance also have this modifier `notBlacklisted(spender)`. This seems unreasonable/unfair to other users. 

Without the ability to revoke allowance while the black-listed address is in blacklist, in the worst case: the black-listed address could front-run other users `decreaseAllowance` tx as soon as they get removed from the blacklist.

```solidity
    function decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue) public whenNotPaused notBlacklisted(msg.sender) notBlacklisted(spender) override returns (bool) {
        address owner = _msgSender();
        uint256 currentAllowance = allowance(owner, spender);
        require(currentAllowance >= subtractedValue, "ERC20: decreased allowance below zero");
        unchecked {
            _approve(owner, spender, currentAllowance - subtractedValue);
        }

        return true;
    }
```
## Impact
other users who would like to revoke allowance to a black-listed address is unable to do so.
