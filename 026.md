# Accept Zero Value in `SwapFunctions.sol`

## Summary
Accept Zero Value in `SwapFunctions.sol`

## Vulnerability Detail
The _convertByFromPrice and _convertByToPrice functions do not handle the case where price is zero.

When calling a function with a price of zero. The function executes successfully but the conversion calculation is incorrect.

## Impact
The conversion calculation would yield a result of zero, regardless of the `fromAmount`. This is because the price is used as a multiplier in the conversion calculation, and any number multiplied by zero is zero.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that price is always greater than zero.
