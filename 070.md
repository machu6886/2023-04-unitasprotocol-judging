# DOS of withdrawing assets if IP does not have enough reserves

## Summary

DOS of withdrawing assets if IP does not have enough reserves.

## Vulnerability Detail

Protocol documentation states that users should be able to withdraw assets even if the reserve ratio falls to less than 100%.
Reserve ratio accounting includes both - reserve on `Unitas.sol` itself and in Insurance Pool:

```solidity
File: Unitas.sol
500:     function _getTotalReservesAndCollaterals() internal view returns (uint256 reserves, uint256 collaterals) {
501:         address baseToken = address(tokenManager.usd1());
502:         uint8 tokenTypeValue = uint8(ITokenManager.TokenType.Asset);
503:         uint256 tokenCount = tokenManager.tokenLength(tokenTypeValue);
504:         uint256 priceBase = 10 ** oracle.decimals(); // 18
505: 
506:         for (uint256 i; i < tokenCount; i++) {
507:             address token = tokenManager.tokenByIndex(tokenTypeValue, i);
508:             uint256 tokenReserve = _getBalance(token);
509:             uint256 tokenCollateral = IInsurancePool(insurancePool).getCollateral(token);
510: 
511:             if (tokenReserve > 0 || tokenCollateral > 0) {
512:                 uint256 price = oracle.getLatestPrice(token);
513: 
514:                 reserves += _convert(
515:                     token,
516:                     baseToken,
517:                     tokenReserve,
518:                     MathUpgradeable.Rounding.Down,
519:                     price,
520:                     priceBase,
521:                     token
522:                 );
523: 
524:                 collaterals += _convert(
525:                     token,
526:                     baseToken,
527:                     tokenCollateral,
528:                     MathUpgradeable.Rounding.Down,
529:                     price,
530:                     priceBase,
531:                     token
532:                 );
533:             }
534:         }
535:     }
```

This means that in case the reserve ratio is < 100% - the sum of all collateral in both contracts would be less than the minted USDx tokens value. This would lead to DOS withdrawing user assets here, since `_swapOut` would revert to trying to withdraw from IP more collateral than it has:

```solidity
File: Unitas.sol
379:     function _swapOut(address token, address receiver, uint256 amount) internal {
380:         ITokenManager.TokenType tokenType = tokenManager.getTokenType(token);
381: 
382:         require(tokenType != ITokenManager.TokenType.Undefined);
383: 
384:         if (tokenType == ITokenManager.TokenType.Asset) {
385:             uint256 tokenReserve = _getBalance(token);
386:             uint256 reserveAmount = amount.min(tokenReserve - _getPortfolio(token));
387: 
388:             if (amount > reserveAmount) {
389:                 uint256 collateralAmount = amount - reserveAmount;
390: 
391:                 // Pull the collateral from insurance pool
392:                 IInsurancePool(insurancePool).withdrawCollateral(token, collateralAmount); 
393:             }
394: 
395:             _setBalance(token, tokenReserve - reserveAmount);
396:             IERC20(token).safeTransfer(receiver, amount);
397:         } else {
398:             IERC20Token(token).mint(receiver, amount);
399:         }
400:     }
401: 
```

## Impact

Users would not be able to withdraw collaterals if the reserve ratio is less than 100%.

## Recommendation

Consider allowing the withdrawal of all left funds in reserves even if reserve ratio is less 100%. This would guarantee that users would be able to withdraw at least some part of the collateral and these funds would not be locked on a `Unitas.sol` contract until the IP balance would be updated.
