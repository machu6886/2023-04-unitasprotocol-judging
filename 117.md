# Swap could revert

## Summary
In some cases where the pair includes USDT, the feeToken in address priceQuoteToken = _getPriceQuoteToken(tokenIn, tokenOut); may be USDT. In this case, if fee > 0, the swap will fail due to the signature check on feeToken.mint
## Vulnerability Detail
USDT does have a function called mint. This function is used to create new USDT tokens and transfer them to a specified address. The mint function can only be called by the owner of the USDT contract, which is Tether Limited
## Impact
swap will revert
