# Unconditional exit from EMCs back to USDPEGA – that is, conversions from USD_EMC to USD1 and then from USD1 to USDPEGA, is not true when _checkPrice fails

## Summary
Unconditional exit from EMCs back to USDPEGA – that is, conversions from USD_EMC to USD1 and then from USD1 to USDPEGA, is not true when _checkPrice fails.

## Vulnerability Detail

call stack:
swap => _getSwapResult => _checkPrice;

if the price of the quoteToken, assuming it's one of the USD_EMC, goes out of the defined min and max, then the conversion path would fails. This is different from the unconditional exit as described from the whitepaper 7.2.1, or page 21
```md
7.2.1 Unconditional Exit and Conditional Minting
In contrast, the protocol performs the following operations only if Dtotal > OCmin :
a) minting USD1 using USDPEGA (i.e., converting USDPEGA to USD1), or
b) minting USD_EMC using USD1 (i.e., converting USD1 to USD_EMC).
USDPEGA  USD1 Unconditional
USD1  USD_EMC Unconditional
USDPEGA ➔ USD1 Only if Dtotal > OCmin
USD1 ➔ USD_EMC Only if Dtotal > OCmin
```

Even though the protocol is able to update the min and max price through TimeLock, however the timelock would need to pass governance vote plus wait until the time delay passes, the swap function would be paused for days if either bound is hit before the threshold can be updated.

_checkPrice
```solidity
    function _checkPrice(address quoteToken, uint256 price) internal view {
        (uint256 minPrice, uint256 maxPrice) = tokenManager.getPriceTolerance(quoteToken);

        _require(minPrice > 0 && maxPrice > 0, Errors.PRICE_TOLERANCE_INVALID);
        _require(minPrice <= price && price <= maxPrice, Errors.PRICE_INVALID);
    }

```

_checkPrice is called in _getSwapResult
```solidity
    function _getSwapResult(
        ITokenManager.PairConfig memory pair,
        address tokenIn,
        address tokenOut,
        AmountType amountType,
        uint256 amount
    )
...
_checkPrice(priceQuoteToken, price);
...
```

_getSwapResult is called in swap
```solidity

    function swap(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, AmountType amountType, uint256 amount)
        external
        whenNotPaused
        nonReentrant
        returns (uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOut)
    {
        IERC20Token feeToken;
        uint256 fee;
        uint24 feeNumerator;
        uint256 price;
        ITokenManager.PairConfig memory pair = tokenManager.getPair(tokenIn, tokenOut);

        (amountIn, amountOut, feeToken, fee, feeNumerator, price) = _getSwapResult(pair, tokenIn, tokenOut, amountType, amount);

```

## Impact
Implementation is not unconditional as described in the whitepaper.

## Recommendation
consider removing the price check if the swap is from `USD_EMC` back to `USD1`, as well as `USD1` back to `USDPEGA`
