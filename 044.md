# XO-Gas Parameter Not Used in SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom

## Summary
- The vulnerability is in the `SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom` function in the `ExplicitERC20` library. The `gas` parameter passed to the function is not being used, which can lead to `transfer` failures if the `gas` provided is `insufficient`. The bug can be fixed by including the `gas` parameter in the function `call`.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
**
     * @notice Override transferFrom to add whenNotPaused and notBlacklisted check.
     * @dev Make a function callable only when the contract is not paused
     * and account is not blacklisted.
     */
    function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) public whenNotPaused notBlacklisted(msg.sender) notBlacklisted(from) notBlacklisted(to) override returns (bool) {
        _spendAllowance(from, _msgSender(), amount);
        _transfer(from, to, amount);
        return true;
    }
```
- In the `transferFrom` function of the `ExplicitERC20` library, the `SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom` function is called with four parameters: `_token`, `_from`, `_to`, and` _quantity`, the fourth parameter, which represents the `gas` to be used for the `transfer`, is not being used in the code. This means that the `transfer` could fail if the `gas` provided by the `caller` is not enough.
## Impact
-  an attacker can cause loss of funds if exploit the vulnerability.
- the vulnerability could lead to the transfer failing, which could lead to loss of funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- the fourth parameter should be passed to the `SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom` function. This will ensure that the `transfer` will always succeed, even if the caller does not provide enough `gas`.
