# Withdrawals could be halted temporarily

## Summary

The protocol accepts USDT as deposits for which it issues USD1 stable coin based on the current price of USD1/USDT. Later users can convert the USD1 to other stable coins like USD91 (INR) based on the INR/USD price feed. The minimum threshold of funds that have to be present when minting USD1 with USDT is expected to be => 130%, which includes the deposit of the user (i.e. reserves) and the funds stored in `InsurancePool.sol` contract, which essentially are used for overcollateralization. The funds in the `InsurancePool.sol` contract (namely USDT) can be utilized by the protocol to "b/ generate yield via external yield venues" as mentioned in the White paper. This is done by invoking the `sendPortfolio` function which transfers the desired amount from  `InsurancePool.sol`  to a receiver (the guardian as example). The debt that the guardian incurs is tracked via the following mapping 
```solidity
mapping(address => uint256) internal _portfolio;
```
Those funds can be repaid at anytime by invoking `receivePortfolio()` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

The problem lies in the withdrawal flow or when a user wants to swap his USD1 balance and receive USDT. When doing that operation there is the following check:

```solidity
_require(collateral - _getPortfolio(token) >= amount, Errors.POOL_BALANCE_INSUFFICIENT);
```

which is performed in the `withdrawCollateral()` function on the `InsurancePool.sol`. The `withdrawCollateral()` function is utilized in the `Unitas.sol` swap flow whenever the collateral stored in the Unitas.sol contract is insufficient to cover the user expected output of USDT. The idea is that the additional collateral needed is pulled from the `InsurancePool.sol`.

However in a situation where the protocol utilized a big percentage of the funds stored in the `InsurancePool.sol` by using `sendPortfolio()` functionality, there could be insufficient collateral for the user to redeem his USD1 for USDT and the `InsurancePool.sol` might not be able to cover the difference which would block the user from withdrawing his USDT.

Imagine the following situation:

1/ Alice mints 100 USD1 by depositing 100 USDT (considering a price of 1:1)
2/ Alice mints USD91 with her 100 USD1, receiving X USD91 (depending on the price)
3/ There are Y amount of USDT on the `InsurancePool.sol`, which the protocol decides to utilize, thus taking those funds out of the contract
4/ The USD91 (INR) price appreciates in value against the USD significantly (all the expected supported stable coins are quite volatile i.e. INR, TRY etc.)
5/ Alice decides to grab her winning so she converts her X USD91 for Z USD1, which shouldn't be a problem as it is burn/mint operation
6/ Alice then decides to convert her gains to USDT, but since she now has way more USD1 than initially (Z > X), Alice should receive more USDT, but the `reserves` does not have a sufficient amount so the `InsurancePool` will have to cover the difference. However the `InsurancePool` does not currently have the funds as they are utilized for yield generation externally, so Alice is unable to withdraw USDT

Of course the protocol could repay the portfolio and Alice would be able to withdraw the USDT she wants, but her withdrawal is halted temporarily which creates a bad UX.

## Impact

A potentially profitable position (as the Alice example above) could be blocked for withdrawal temporarily due to lack of funds in the `InsurancePool.sol`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I would suggest setting a `limit` in terms of % on how much can be withdrawn from the `InsurancePool.sol` and utilized for yield generation outside of the protocol. This would make sure that the above mentioned situation is very unlikely to happen, while at the same time protecting the protocol and its' users from a potential exploit on external platform by decreasing the possible impact.
