# Inaccurate Balance Tracking in _receivePortfolio() and _sendPortfolio() Vulnerable to DoS and Loss of Funds

## Summary
`_sendPortfolio` && `_receivePortfolio`  send and receive tokens and update the portfolio sate, but neither of those does update the balances state. This means tokens are send or received, but they are not accounted for.

## Vulnerability Detail
In [`_receivePortfolio()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/PoolBalances.sol#L64-L78) and [`_sendPortfolio()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/PoolBalances.sol#L83-L99) balances are not updated. This is inaccurate accounting and could lead to DoS or loss of user funds.

Example:
Contract has 10k USDT in balances and 10 000 in investment portfolio 10 000 : 10 000
- Governance withdraws 5k USDT from the portfolio(no balance update is triggered)
     real token amounts    15000 : 5000      
     what the contract is tracking 10 000 : 10 000

If users want to withdraw their money it will fail due to the contract thinking it has low balance, but the actual tokens are gonna be there, in the contract.

## Impact
Loss of funds and DoS
## Code Snippet
```jsx
    function _receivePortfolio(address token, address sender, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        AddressUtils.checkNotZero(token);
        AddressUtils.checkNotZero(sender);
        _checkAmountPositive(amount);
        _require(sender != address(this), Errors.SENDER_INVALID);

        uint256 portfolio = _getPortfolio(token);
        _require(amount <= portfolio, Errors.AMOUNT_INVALID);
        
        _setPortfolio(token, portfolio - amount);//@audit portfolio is updated, but balance is not?
        //@audit why there is no balance update when funds are received?
        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(sender, address(this), amount);

        emit PortfolioReceived(token, sender, amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
update the balance when receiving ans sending out funds
```jsx
+    _setBalance(token, portfolio + amount);
```
