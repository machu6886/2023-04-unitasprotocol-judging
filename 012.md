# Failure to Remove Allowances on Blacklisted Addresses Leads to Loss of Funds

## Summary
If you give allowance to a user and he turns malicious and gets blacklisted, because `notBlacklisted(spender)` you are not able to decrease it. If in the future he gets whitelisted and being able to spend tokens, he would be able to drain you.

## Vulnerability Detail
So you have granted some approvals on tokens to some users, but one of them turn malicious, and before you could call [`decreaseAllowance()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/ERC20Token.sol#L241-L250), the governance blacklist them. Now if you try to remove the allowance (because the user is malicious) you are not gonna be able to due to:
```jsx
function decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue) public whenNotPaused notBlacklisted(msg.sender) 
```

The allowance stays, and if one day the user gets removed from the blacklist ([`removeBlackList()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/ERC20Token.sol#L272-L275C6)), he would still have the previous allowance that you gave him. Thus he would be able to use your tokens for malicious stuff again.

```jsx
    function decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue) public whenNotPaused notBlacklisted(msg.sender) notBlacklisted(spender) override returns (bool) {
        address owner = _msgSender();
        uint256 currentAllowance = allowance(owner, spender);
        require(currentAllowance >= subtractedValue, "ERC20: decreased allowance below zero");
        unchecked {
            _approve(owner, spender, currentAllowance - subtractedValue);
        }

        return true;
    }
```
## Impact
User lose funds, because they are not able to remove approvals on blacklisted addresses.
