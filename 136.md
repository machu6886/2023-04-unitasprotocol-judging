# Timelock cannot run repeated operations

## Summary

Timelock breaks for repeat operations.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract `TimelockController.sol` takes care of scheduling operations. The contract uses a value of 0 to denote a non-existent operation, and a value of 1 to denote a completed operation. The functions `isOperation` and `isOperationPending` checks against these values.

This function checks if the scheduled timestamp is non zero, checking if it exists.

This function checks if the scheduled timestamp is more than 1, meaning it has to exist and be pending.

In the function `schedule`, the contract checks the timestamp value of an operation in the internal function `_schedule`.

Here the contract checks against the `isOperation` modifier. Now this modifier returns returns true only if the action does not exist at all. This means that if the timelock controller passes an action, it will be marked with a timestamp of 1, instead of 0, and thus the timelock will not be able to pass the same action again, since `isOperation` check will always fail since 1>0. Thus the timelock controller cannot schedule actions it has scheduled and completed in the past.

This can be a major issue on all the `onlyTimelock` functions. For example, the function `sendPortfolio` is guarded by this modifier, and thus the timelock can can send an amount to an address only once. The next call, either the address or the amount has to be different to generate a new hash since old actions cannot be repeated due to the incorrect function. Same goes for the `setOracle` function, where if an oracle is set and unset, it cannot be reset to the same address since the hash of that action already exists, and is marked with a timestamp of 1.

## Impact

Broken timelock contract. Cannot schedule repeat operations.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use the modifier `isOperationPending`. The timelock is meant to stop repeat operations being executed within a timelock period, not stop operations which have already been executed.
