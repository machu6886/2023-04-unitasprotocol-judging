# Minting stables such as USD91 using USD1 with Reserve ratio ≤ 130% will fail

## Summary
Minting stables such as USD91 using USD1 with Reserve ratio ≤ 130% will fail

## Vulnerability Detail

When `Reserve ratio ≤ 130%` there are different instructions that hold for that specific reserve ratio: 

```solidity
Pause USD1 minting temporarily
Allow minting of USD91 and USD971, USD971, USD886 & USD84
wait for reserve ratio to go above >130% to restart minting USD1 from USDT
allow exit of USD91,USD971, USD886 & USD84 to USD1
allow exit of USD1 to USDT
```

In the following case:  
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol-0xffff11/tree/main/Unitas-Protocol#minting-usd91-and-other-emcs-using-usd1

minting of `USD91 ` and other `EMCS` must be allowed if reserve ratio is ≤ 130%.

Codes fails to deliver and does not allow to mint other EMCS with USD1 because as you can see on the code:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/Unitas.sol#L228-L232

When this scenario happens the token used to charge fees is `usd1`, the base token. However, as the protocol says, `usd1` minting will be paused if ratio is <= 130%. Meaning that any minting of EMCS using `usd1` will fail

## Impact
Unable to buy EMCs with `usd1`, breaking crucial invariant

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the feeToken to the EMC minted at the moment of reserve ratio <=130%
