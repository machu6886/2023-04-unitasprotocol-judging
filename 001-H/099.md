# No `amountLimit` in `swap` function

## Summary

No `amountLimit` parameter in `swap` function

## Vulnerability Detail

[Swap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/Unitas.sol#L208) function doesn't contain an `amountLimit`, a user might end up receiving a different amount of assets than expected, or spending more than intended due to price changes during the transaction's execution. 

## Impact

Financial loss due to receiving execution of the transaction in a time not controlled by the user

## Code Snippet

```solidity
// amountLimit parameter missing
function swap(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, AmountType amountType, uint256 amount)
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add `amountLimit` parameter to `swap` function, 
and revert the transaction if `amountOut`  won't be greater or equal to amountLimit if the `amountType` is `IN`,
or revert if `amountIn` will be greater than `amountLimit`if the `amountType` is `OUT`,
