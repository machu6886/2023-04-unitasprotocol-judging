# Front-Running Vulnerability in SwapFunctions Contract

## Summary

In the provided `SwapFunctions.sol` contract, the functions `_calculateSwapResultByAmountIn` and `_calculateSwapResultByAmountOut` calculate the amount of input and output tokens for a swap operation, including the fee calculation. However, due to the inherent design of the Ethereum blockchain, these functions are prone to front-running attacks. Attackers may take advantage of the time delay between when a transaction is submitted and when it is executed to alter the outcome of the transaction.

## Vulnerability Detail

Front-running is a type of attack in which an attacker observes a transaction that has been broadcast to the network but has not yet been included in a block. By creating a similar transaction with a higher gas price, the attacker can increase the likelihood that their transaction will be included first, potentially causing the original transaction to fail or have unintended consequences.

In this case, an attacker could observe a pending swap operation on the network and create a similar swap operation but with a slightly better rate (by modifying `request.price` and `request.priceBase`), and a higher gas price. If the attacker's transaction is mined first, it could potentially affect the swap rate for the original transaction. This is because the swap rate could depend on the total supply of tokens or the balance of tokens in the contract, which might have changed due to the attacker's transaction.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability can be significant. The user who originally submitted the swap operation may end up with less output tokens than expected. In extreme cases, this could lead to financial loss for the user.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _calculateSwapResultByAmountIn(SwapRequest memory request)
    internal
    view
    virtual
    returns (uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOut, uint256 fee)
{
    ...
}

function _calculateSwapResultByAmountOut(SwapRequest memory request)
    internal
    view
    virtual
    returns (uint256 amountIn, uint256 amountOut, uint256 fee)
{
    ...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, consider implementing a mechanism to prevent front-running attacks. One common method is to use a commit-reveal scheme. In this scheme, users first submit a hashed version of their transaction (the "commit" phase). Once all transactions for a certain period have been submitted, users then reveal their actual transactions (the "reveal" phase). The transactions are then executed in the order they were originally submitted, preventing front-running.

## Proof Of Concept

To reproduce the vulnerability, follow these steps:

1. User A submits a transaction to the `SwapFunctions` contract, calling the `_calculateSwapResultByAmountIn` or `_calculateSwapResultByAmountOut` function.

2. Before User A's transaction is included in a block, Attacker B observes the transaction in the mempool. Attacker B constructs a similar transaction but with a slightly better rate and a higher gas price.

3. Attacker B's transaction is included in a block before User A's transaction due to the higher gas price. This changes the swap rate for User A's transaction, potentially causing User A to receive less output tokens than expected.

4. Finally, User A's transaction is included in a block, but the outcome is different than expected due to the change in swap rate caused by Attacker B's transaction.
