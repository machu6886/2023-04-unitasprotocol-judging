# Swap result is calculated with a wrong price when buying USD1.

## Summary
Swaps are made based on a wrong token price, when buying USD1.

## Vulnerability Detail
At the end of the function `_getSwapResults` an if statement is triggered when tokenIn equals priceQuoteToken, this indicated the swap is used in order to buy USD1 and that the oracle price should be inverted. 

By the dev comment - it is cleary stated that the price should be inverted when the swap is used for buying USD1.

But since the if statement is applied at the end of the function, nothing actually happens and the swap result is already calculated using the wrong price.

## Impact
Swaps are made based on a wrong token price, when buying USD1.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When a swap is made in order to buy USD1, the oracle price should be inverted before the function calculates the swap result:

```solidity
        SwapRequest memory request;
        request.tokenIn = tokenIn;
        request.tokenOut = tokenOut;
        request.amountType = amountType;
        request.amount = amount;
        request.feeNumerator = feeNumerator;
        request.feeBase = tokenManager.SWAP_FEE_BASE();
        request.feeToken = address(feeToken);
        request.price = price;
        request.priceBase = 10 ** oracle.decimals();
        request.quoteToken = priceQuoteToken;

        if (tokenIn == priceQuoteToken) {
            // The base currency of oracle price is USD1, inverts the price when buying USD1
            price = request.priceBase * request.priceBase / price;
            request.price = price;
        }

        (amountIn, amountOut, fee) = _calculateSwapResult(request);

        _require(amountIn > 0 && amountOut > 0, Errors.SWAP_RESULT_INVALID);
```
