# `XOracle.putPrice()` Can Fall Victim to Front-running Attacks: Attackers Can Make Quick Profits, while Users Can Avoid Loss and even Turn the Potential Loss into Profits.

## Summary
`XOracle.putPrice()`, which sets and updates the price of the supported tokens, especially EMC tokens. However, this functionality can be vulnerable to exploitation by attackers and malicious users.

## Vulnerability Detail

### Proof-of-concept
- Suppose, 1 USD = 82.5 INR, 1 USD1 = 82.5 USD91. 
- INR depreciates and the USD/INR price increases to 85. (1 USD1 = 85 USD91)
- The PriceFeeder calls the `putPrice` function to increase the price of the USD91 to its new value.
- The Attacker monitors the mempool and observes the PriceFeeder's transaction to update the USD91 price.
- Sensing an opportunity, the Attacker front runs the PriceFeeder's transaction by submitting their own transaction with a higher gas fee.
- The Attacker calls the `Unitas.swap()` function to purchase 50,000 USD91 tokens with paying High Gas Fee.
- Due to the higher gas fee, the Attacker's transaction gets executed before the PriceFeeder's transaction, granting the Attacker ownership of the 50,000 USD91 tokens at the previous price of 82.5
- After the PriceFeeder's transaction is eventually executed and the price is updated to 85, the Attacker decides to sell all the USD91 he acquired.
- Capitalizing on the price increase, the Attacker successfully sells the 50,000 USD91 tokens at the new price of 85.
- Attacker makes a quick $5000 profit.

## Impact
Attackers have the ability to make quick profits, while users can prevent losses and even turn the potential loss into profits

## Recommendation
- Use Oracle
- Delay TRX Method on `swap()`
- pause `swap()` while price updates
