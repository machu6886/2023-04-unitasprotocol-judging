# Last withdrawal would be blocked

## Summary

Last withdrawal would be blocked.

## Vulnerability Detail

At the end of the `swap()` execution `Unitas.sol` checks the current reserve ratio and reserve status and reverts swaps in case these values are wrong:
```solidity
File: Unitas.sol
605:     function _checkReserveRatio(uint232 reserveRatioThreshold) internal view {
606:         if (reserveRatioThreshold == 0) {
607:             return;
608:         } else {
609:             (uint256 reserves, uint256 collaterals) = _getTotalReservesAndCollaterals();
610:             uint256 allReserves = reserves + collaterals;
611:             uint256 liabilities = _getTotalLiabilities();
612: 
613:             (ReserveStatus reserveStatus, uint256 reserveRatio) = _getReserveStatus(allReserves, liabilities);
614: 
615:             if (reserveStatus != ReserveStatus.Infinite) { 
616:                 _require(reserveRatio > reserveRatioThreshold, Errors.RESERVE_RATIO_NOT_GREATER_THAN_THRESHOLD);
617:             }
618:         }
619:     }
```

`reserveStatus` could have 3 values:
- `Undefined` when `allReserves` and `liabilities` are zero
- `Infinite` when `liabilities` is zero
- Otherwise `Finite`

So the `_checkReserveRatio()` function would check the `reserveRatio` value in 2 cases - when `allReserves` and `liabilities` are both zero or non-zero.

The second case would take place most time of protocol existence, while the first case could take place when the last token holder would be withdrawing collateral and IP reserves would be equal to 0 (because of protocol become abandoned for example). In such a scenario at the end of the swap execution `allReserves` and `liabilities` would be equal to 0 and the transaction would be reverted due to not enough `reserveRatio` in line 616.

Basically it would create a situation when the contract has enough collateral (1 to 1  to user's tokens) but withdrawing would be impossible.

## Impact

Last withdrawer would not be able to withdraw all left collateral from the protocol.

## Recommendation

Consider updating the reserve ratio check to the next:
```solidity
-           if (reserveStatus != ReserveStatus.Infinite) { 
+           if (reserveStatus == ReserveStatus.Finite) { 
                _require(reserveRatio > reserveRatioThreshold, Errors.RESERVE_RATIO_NOT_GREATER_THAN_THRESHOLD);
            }
```
