# PoolBalances.sol:contract that allows arbitrary senders to execute safeTransferFrom calls.

## Summary
The PoolBalances._receivePortfolio function in the PoolBalances.sol contract uses an arbitrary sender address in the safeTransferFrom call, potentially allowing unauthorized transfers of tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the _receivePortfolio function, the safeTransferFrom call does not verify the actual sender address, which can be manipulated by an attacker. This allows an attacker to initiate transfers from any account to the PoolBalances contract without proper authorization.

## Impact
The vulnerability enables unauthorized transfers of tokens to the PoolBalances contract. This can lead to unauthorized depletion of token balances and potential loss of funds for the affected accounts.

## Code Snippet
The vulnerability exists in the _receivePortfolio function at 
<a> https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-04-unitasprotocol/blob/main/Unitas-Protocol/src/PoolBalances.sol#L64 </a>
of the PoolBalances.sol file.

 The function uses an arbitrary from address in the transferFrom call: IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(sender, address(this), amount).

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix the vulnerability in the _receivePortfolio function, you can implement proper validation of the sender address before executing the safeTransferFrom call. Here's an example of a possible fix:
<pre><code>
function _receivePortfolio(address token, address sender, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
    AddressUtils.checkNotZero(token);
    AddressUtils.checkNotZero(sender);
    _checkAmountPositive(amount);
    _require(sender != address(this), Errors.SENDER_INVALID);

    uint256 portfolio = _getPortfolio(token);
    _require(amount <= portfolio, Errors.AMOUNT_INVALID);

    _setPortfolio(token, portfolio - amount);

    // Add sender validation here
    require(isAuthorized(sender), "PoolBalances: Unauthorized sender");

    IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(sender, address(this), amount);

    emit PortfolioReceived(token, sender, amount);
}
</code></pre>

It is recommended to ensure that the sender address passed to the safeTransferFrom function is validated and matches the expected sender. This validation can include checking the authorization of the sender address and verifying that it corresponds to the expected account initiating the transfer.

By implementing this validation, the vulnerability can be mitigated, preventing unauthorized transfers and enhancing the security of the PoolBalances contract.
